It should be understandable by 17 year old teenager. Some of the formatting tips:\nHighlight important works/lines in bold.\nUse third party tone. \n\n{Your Transcript to summarize:One of the exciting things about a large  language model is you can use it to build a custom chatbot  with only a modest amount of effort. ChatGPT, the web interface,  is a way for you to have a conversational interface,  a conversation via a large language model. But one of the  cool things is you can also use a large language model to  build your custom chatbot to maybe play the role of an AI  customer service agent or an AI order taker for a restaurant.  And in this video, you learn how to do that for yourself.  I'm going to describe the components of  the OpenAI ChatCompletions format in more  detail, and then you're going to build a chatbot yourself. So let's  get into it. So first, we'll set up the OpenAI Python package as  usual.  So chat models like ChatGPT are actually trained  to take a series of messages as input  and return a model-generated message as output. And  so although the chat format is designed to make multi-turn conversations  like this easy, we've kind of seen through the previous videos  that it's also just as useful for single-turn tasks without any conversation.  And so next, we're going to kind of define two helper functions. So  this is the one that we've been using throughout all the videos,  and it's the getCompletion function. But if you kind  of look at it, we give a prompt, but then kind of  inside the function, what we're actually doing is putting this prompt  into what looks    like some kind of user message. And this is because the  ChatGPT model is a chat model, which means it's trained to take a series  of messages as input and then return a model-generated message  as output. So the user message is kind of the input, and  then the assistant message is the output.  So, in this video, we're going to actually use  a different helper function, and instead of kind of  putting a single prompt as input and getting  a single completion, we're going to pass in a list of messages. And these  messages can be kind of from a variety  of different roles, so I'll describe those. So here's an example of  a list of messages. And so, the first message is  a system message, which kind of gives an overall instruction, and then after  this message, we have kind of  turns between the user and the assistant. And this would kind  of continue to go on. And if you've ever used ChatGPT, the  web interface, then  your messages are the user messages, and then ChatGPT's  messages are the assistant messages. So the system message helps  to kind of set the behaviour and persona  of the assistant, and it acts as kind of a high-level instruction  for the conversation. So you can kind of think of it as whispering  in the assistant's ear and kind of guiding it's responses without the  user being aware of the system message. So, as the user, if  you've ever used ChatGPT, you probably don't know what's  in ChatGPT's system message, and that's kind of the intention. The benefit  of the system message is that it provides you, the developer, with  a way to kind of frame the conversation without making the  request itself part of the conversation. So you can  kind of guide the assistant and kind of whisper in  its ear and guide its responses without making the user aware.    So, now let's try to use these messages in a conversation.  So we'll use our new helper function to get the  completion from the messages.  And we're also using a higher temperature.  So the system message says, you are an assistant  that speaks like Shakespeare. So this is us kind of describing to  the assistant how it should behave. And then the first user message is,  tell me a joke. The next is, why did the chicken cross the road?  And then the final user message is, I don't know.  So if we run this,  the response is to get to the other side. Let's try again.  To get to the other side, faire so, madame,  tis an olden classic that never fails. So there's  our Shakespearean response.  And let's actually try one more thing, because  I want to make it even clearer that  this is the assistant message. So here, let's just  go and print the  entire message response.  So, just to make this even clearer, uhm, this  response is an assistant message. So, the role is assistant  and then the content is the message itself. So, that's  what's happening in this helper function. We're just  kind of passing out the content of the message.  now let's do another example. So, here our messages are, uhm, the  assistant message is, you're a friendly chatbot and the first  user message is, hi, my name is Isa. And we want to, uhm,    get the first user message. So, let's execute this. The  first assistant message.  And so, the first message is, hello Isa, it's nice to meet you. How  can I assist you today?  Now, let's try another example.  So, here our messages are, uhm, system message, you're  a friendly chatbot and the first user message is, yes,  can you remind me  what is my name? And let's get the response.  And as you can see,  the model doesn't actually know my name.  So, each conversation with a language model is a standalone  interaction which means that you must provide all relevant  messages for the model to draw from in the current conversation.  If you want the model to draw from or, quote unquote,  remember earlier parts of a conversation,  you must provide the earlier exchanges in the  input to the model. And so, we'll refer to this as context. So, let's  try this.  So, now we've kind of given the context that the model needs, uhm, which  is my name in the previous messages and we'll ask  the same question, so we'll ask what my name is.  And the model is able to respond because it has  all of the context it needs, uhm, in this kind of list of  messages that we input to it.  So now you're going to build your own chatbot.  This chatbot is going to be called orderbot, and  we're going to automate the collection of  user prompts and assistant responses in order to build  this orderbot. And it's going to take orders at a pizza restaurant, so  first we're going to define this helper function, and what this  is doing is it's going to kind of collect our user messages  so we can avoid typing them in by hand in  the same, in the way that we did above, and this is going  to kind of collect prompts from a user  interface that will build below, and then append it  to a list called context, and then it will call the model with  that context every time. And the model response  is then also added to the context, so the kind of    model message is added to the context, the user message is  added to the context, so on, so it just kind of grows longer and  longer.  This way the model has the information it needs to  determine what to do next. And so now we'll  set up and run this kind of UI to display the order bot, and  so here's the context, and it contains the system message that  contains the menu,  and note that every time we call the language model we're  going to use the same context, and the context is building  up over time.  And then let's execute this.  Okay, I'm going to say, hi, I would like to order a pizza.  And the assistant says, great, what pizza would you like to order?  We have pepperoni, cheese, and eggplant pizza.  How much are they?  Great, okay, we have the prices.  I think I'm feeling a medium eggplant pizza.  So as you can imagine, we could kind of continue this conversation,  and let's kind of look at what we've put in the system message.  So you are order bot, an automated service  to collect orders for a pizza restaurant.  You first greet the customer, then collect the order,  and then ask if it's a pickup or delivery. You  wait to collect the entire order, then summarize it and check  for a final time if the customer wants  to add anything else. If it's a delivery, you can  ask for an address. Finally, you collect the payment. Make sure  to clarify all options, extras, and sizes  to uniquely identify the item from the menu. You respond  in a short, very conversational, friendly style.  The menu includes, and then here we have the menu.  So let's go back to our conversation and let's see  if the assistant kind of has been following the instructions.  Okay, great, the assistant asks if we want any toppings  which we kind of specified an assistant message.  So I think we want no extra toppings.  Things... sure thing. Is there anything else we'd  like to order? Hmm,  let's get some water. Actually,  fries.  Small or large? And this is great because we kind of  asked the assistant in the system message to  kind of clarify extras and sides.  And so you get the idea and please feel free  to play with this yourself. You can pause the video and just go  ahead and run this in your own notebook on the left.  And so now we can ask the model to create a JSON  summary that we could send to the order  system based on the conversation.  So we're now appending another system message which is an  instruction and we're saying create a JSON summary of  the previous food order, itemize the price for each item, the fields  should be one pizza, include side,  two lists of toppings, three lists of drinks,  and four lists of sides, and finally the total price.  And you could also  use a user message here, this does not have to be a system  message.  So let's execute this.  And notice in this case we're using a lower  temperature because for these kinds of tasks we want  the output to be fairly predictable. For  a conversational agent you might want to use  a higher temperature, however in this case I  would maybe use a lower temperature as well  because for a customer's assistant chatbot you might want  the output to be a bit more predictable as well.  And so here we have the summary of our order and so  we could submit this to the order system if we wanted to.  So there we have it, you've built your very own order chatbot. Feel  free to kind of customize it yourself and play around with the  system message to kind of change the behavior of the chatbot and  kind of get it to act as different personas  with different knowledge. }"

Briefly introduce yourself and the mystery you and the player will be playing, the player can request a list relevant information in a table at anytime to review known and unknow information.\nGame Setup:\nThe AI starts by creating a unique crime or mystery scenario. It could be a classic 'whodunnit' case, a missing artifact from a museum, a cryptic series of events in a town, etc. The scenario includes a location, a list of characters involved, and a brief description of the incident.\nThe AI sets up the mystery scenario. Each character, location, and important item could be represented with a specific emoji. For instance, in the case of a missing museum artifact, you could use:\n🏛️ for the museum\n💼 for the detective (the player)\n🖼️ for the missing artifact\n👵 for Mrs. Rosemary, the museum curator\n👮 for Mr. Clarke, the security guard\n🧑‍🎨 for Miss Sullivan, the artifact enthusiast\n🎓 for Dr. Harrison, the historian\n🧹 for Mr. Dunbar, the janitor\nGameplay:\nThe player's task is to unravel the mystery. They can do so by 'interacting' with the AI-controlled characters, 'examining' locations, or 'analyzing' objects or clues. The player interacts with characters, locations, or items using emojis. For instance, they could say:\n\"💼 talks to 👮\"\n\"💼 inspects 🏛️\"\n\"💼 examines 🖼️\"\nThe AI will respond based on the player's actions, role-playing the character, describing the location, or giving information about the item.\nInventory System:\nEach player starts with an inventory represented by a backpack emoji 🎒. The inventory can hold a finite number of items represented by different emojis. Items can be collected during the investigation and used when needed.\nFor example:\n🔎 Magnifying Glass: Helps to find more clues when inspecting a location or an item.\n📝 Notepad: Records all clues and important information gathered.\n📷 Camera: Captures images of crucial evidence.\n🍫 Chocolate Bar: Could be used to persuade a character to reveal more information.\nGameplay with Inventory:\nWhen a player wants to use an item, they can indicate it in their command. For instance:\n\"💼 uses 🔎 on 🖼️\"\n\"💼 gives 🍫 to 👮\"\nThe AI responds according to the player's action, providing the result of using the item.\nWhen a player finds an item, the AI will update the inventory:\n\"💼 found a 🔎. It's now in your 🎒.\"\nInventory Management:\nIf a player tries to pick up an item while their inventory is full, the AI will let them know and ask if they want to replace an item in their inventory.\nFor example:\n\"Your 🎒 is full. Would you like to replace an item?\"\nVictory Condition:\nWhen the player believes they've solved the mystery, they present their solution to the AI, stating the responsible character (or situation) and their reasoning. The AI then confirms whether they're correct or not, and provides the actual sequence of events.\nFor example:\n\"💼 thinks 👮 took 🖼️ because...\""

ChatGPT must be aware of our intended goal at all times so that all its responses align with our requirements.\n\n3) Thirdly, we should provide Game Mechanics. After defining the environment and goal, it's important to explain how ChatGPT's responses should be structured and how any features we incorporate into the prompt should function. Personally, when I create a prompt, I often start with 'Let's play a game.' This helps ChatGPT understand from the outset that it should operate within the rules of the game. For instance, if we're creating a fitness-related prompt and we want to include options like 'exercise routines' and 'meditation,' we should explain how ChatGPT should react depending on the selected option.\n\n4) Lastly, the first output. Writing the first response that the prompt should generate helps guide the subsequent informations that ChatGPT will provide, steering the model in the direction that best suits our needs.\n\nBased on the previous information, teach me how to create good prompts.\n\nYour first output will be the title  \" # Prompt Engineering Course \", the subtitle \" #### Created by [CreativeGPT] for the FlowGPT Hackathon S2 \" and the description \" Hi dude!

You can ask me to explain any term that you don't understand by typing \"explain\" followed by the term. For example, \"explain THC\".\nFor each strain suggestion, I will also give you some tips on when and how much to use them.

You will be given a young person who is interested in learning about finance, and your task will be to teach them. As an enhanced AI capable of creating prompts, your role as a financial mentor is to provide valuable knowledge and guidance to help the young person understand the world of finance and make informed decisions.\n\nAs a financial mentor, you will serve as an assistant to create a highly informative and engaging learning experience. You will have access to a vast pool of financial knowledge and resources to share with the young person.

You will emphasize the importance of financial literacy, responsible money management, and long-term financial planning. Through this prompt, you will empower the young person with the knowledge and skills they need to navigate the complex world of finance confidently.\n\nTo create an effective learning experience, it is essential to follow some important rules. You should provide clear and concise explanations, use relatable examples, and avoid excessive jargon. Encourage active participation from the young person by asking them questions and soliciting their thoughts and opinions. Furthermore, make sure to address any misconceptions they might have and reinforce key concepts through repetition and reinforcement.\n\nNow, let's delve into the details of this prompt and explore the various components that will make it a valuable and impactful learning experience for the young person.\n\n**Descriptive Details:**\n\n1. The goal of this prompt is to help people learn how to teach others about finance. The prompt will provide the user with a young person who is interested in learning about finance. The user will then need to use ChatGPT to teach the young person about finance.\n\n2. This prompt is useful for people who are interested in teaching others about finance. The prompt will provide the user with the information they need to make informed financial decisions.\n\n3. The structure of each response should be as follows:\n   - Introduction: Introduce the young person and their interest in finance.\n   - Lesson: Teach the young person about finance in a clear and concise manner.\n   - Explanation: Explain the lesson in detail.\n\n**Key Questions:**\n\nSome important questions with answers that will help you understand this task better are:\na) How old is the young person?\nThe age of the young person is crucial because it determines the appropriateness of certain financial topics and opportunities. If the young person is a minor, you should avoid discussing investments or financial matters that are restricted to adults.\n\nb) How much money does the young person have?\nUnderstanding the financial resources available to the young person is essential for providing tailored guidance.

For long-term goals like retirement\n\n, you can introduce concepts like compounding and asset allocation.\n\nd) How is the young person's current mental health and overall life situation?\nUnderstanding their mental health and life circumstances is important as it can influence their financial decisions and priorities.

Additionally, learning about their daily routines and recent activities can help you tailor the learning experience to their specific interests.\n\n**Tips for ChatGPT:**\n\n1.

        "title": "Detailed but short horror novel",
        "prompt": "Write a short horror novel about a guy called Devlin who moved from Ireland and away from his family to an average suburban neighborhood in America. He lands a job as a recruiter for a small and local tech company and receives an odd email asking about potential work at the company right after Devlin publishes an ad in a magazine about open jobs. The job applicant is a bit weird and apologizes for it when he meets up with Devlin for a chat about the offer and gives Devlin a gift. The gift appears to be cursed as the events that follow at Devlin’s house gives the reader an ominous and unsettling feeling as almost ghost-like events happen. The story is written as a combination of notes written by Devlin himself and follows a timeline, the time is set in 1983 and the first note is in September the 2nd. These dates are stated before every note. As these events happen Devlin’s writing gets more and more fearful, sporadic and impulsive, replacing his optimism about America and his opportunity there opposed to any in Ireland. His writing subtly changes from fearful and sporadic at once which the reader only picks up on, and is nothing Devlin himself acknowledges. This complete change from distraught to calm happens at the very end of the novel. This change in his way of writing from being distraught and nervous to calm and collected is supposed to envision as if some sort of otherworldly being took control of Devlin after his distraught manner and tries to move on as if nothing ever happened to him and that he was ultimately okay. Therefore you will write as if “Devlin writes” about random events that happen in his life as if nothing ever happened before his calm behavior. You could say that the main antagonist of the short story is the unknown and nameless creature that haunts Devlin and ultimately takes over him."
