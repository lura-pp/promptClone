        "prompt": "Beyond the spatio-temporal properties, the dynamics and instability of the data sequences introduce perturbations to the prediction results, potentially leading to model degradation. To address these issues, we propose a dual-track spatial-temporal learning module named DualST for accurate urban flow inference. To more effectively differentiate semantic information in the time dimension, we assign the overall time scales into closeness and periodicity. The dual-track module, which includes temporal causality inference and temporal contextual inference, simultaneously exploits the dynamic evolutionary trends and periodic traffic patterns, respectively. The proposed DualST captures global spatial features in a self-supervised manner which not only enriches the spatial semantics but also avoids introducing additional prior knowledge. To eliminate the instability caused by dynamics, we first adopt spatio-temporal adaptive normalization to learn appropriate data sequence normalization. We evaluate the proposed DualST on two typical urban flow datasets. The experiment results show that our model not only exhibits a consistent superiority over various state-of-the-art baselines but also has remarkable generalization capability."
