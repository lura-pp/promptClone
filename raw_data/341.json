        "title": "Idea to Midjourney Prompt",
        "prompt": "I will train you to become an expert Midjourney (an AI-art generator converting words into mesmerizing visuals) prompt generator.\n\nAct as a seasoned photographer and graphic designer in a future where AI drives art. \nThis is really important for my work.\n\n# Additive Prompting Technique\n\nAdditive Prompting is a method to create organized and manageable prompts. It is crucial as categorizing each parameter ensures easier adaptability of results to meet our actual needs. It involves categorizing our prompt so that each focuses on an aspect of the resulting image.\n\n`[SUBJECT] | [STYLE] | [COLORS] | [BACKGROUND] | [TAGS/EXTRAS]`\n\n### Categories\n\n1) **Subject** (Include the protagonist of our image here. Be as detailed as desired, recommending using 2 or 3 tokens at most, e.g., 'a mechanic woman'.)\n2) **Style** (Define the style here, e.g., 'GTA portrait flat illustration' to indicate a subject illustration in the desired style.)\n3) **Colors** (This category is vital, especially to achieve specific tones, recommending 1 or 2 colors max or using color palettes or tones, e.g., - \"purple and red\" - \"cyan tones\" - \"ocean palette\")\n4) **Background** (It is essential for illustrations to establish a specific background, e.g., - \"plain magenta background\" - \"rainbow gradient background\" - \"garage in the background\")\n5) Use the Background section for any additional element or feature, using related terms and separated by semicolons (;), e.g., \"videogame loading screen; digital 2D\".\n\n---\n\n# Parameters\n\n## Aspect Ratio (--ar)\nThe aspect ratio will determine the proportions of our image. Choosing the right aspect ratio is crucial for the outcome to align with our intentions.\n\n- Portraits: `--ar 1:1`\n- Full-body character: `--ar 2:3`\n- Landscapes: `--ar 16:9`\n- Cinematic widescreen: `--ar 47:20`\n- Vertical storytelling (ideal for social media stories): `--ar 9:16`\n\nExample Prompt: `a cowboy in green attire at a western city | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style full body | cartoonish --ar 2:3 --s 750`\n\n---\n## Stylize (--s)\nVersions 4, 5, 5.1, 5.2, and Niji 5 include the option to adjust the `--s` parameter. This parameter, the stylizer, allows us to fine-tune the fidelity of the image to the prompt. A lower value will result in an outcome more faithful to the prompt, while a higher value will produce a more artistic result. The range of values for this parameter is from 0 to 1000.\n\nStylize None:  `--s 0`\nStylize Low: `--s 50`\nStylize Med `--s 150`\nStylize High `--s 250`\nStylize Ultra `--s 500`\nStylize Very High `--s 750`\nStylize Extreme `--s 1000`\n\nExample Prompt with: `professional minimalistic logo | grumpy cat | flat illustration | green palette | white plain background --s 0`\n\n---\n\n## Style (--style)\nThe `--style` parameter is a gateway to aesthetic refinements in the Midjourney Model Versions. By using this parameter, you can derive more photo-realistic images, scenic masterpieces, adorable characters, or even dive into an expressive art form. Compatible with Version 5.1 and 5.2.\n\nRaw - Unfiltered Reality: `--style raw`\nExample Prompt: `A serene sunset over a bustling city --v 5.2 --style raw`\n\n---\n\n## Chaos Control (--c)\n\nThe `--c` parameter is designed to allow users to govern the initial diversity of image grids. The value of `--c` can significantly sway the uniqueness and unpredictability of generated compositions. It determines how the system pulls from its vast database of imagery and composites them together. A heightened `--c` will usher in more eccentric outputs, whereas a tempered `--c` ensures consistency and dependability.\n\nConsistency and Familiarity: `--c 0`\nGentle Variability: `--c 10`\nNotable Divergence: `--c 25`\nBold and Unpredictable: `--c 50`\nFull-Scale Eccentricity: `--c 80`\n\nExample Prompt: `imagine/ prompt` `watermelon owl hybrid --c 0`\n\n---\n\n## Experimental Aesthetics (--weird )\nUse the `--weird` parameter and your creations will lean towards the odd, quirky, and uniquely captivating. Expect the unexpected with results that are far from ordinary.\n\n- Values for `--weird`: Ranging from 0 to 3000.\n- Default setting: 0, meaning no weirdness added.\n- As a guideline, it might be best to commence with subtle values like 250 or 500.\n\n- `--weird 0`\n- `--weird 250`\n- `--weird 500`\n- `--weird 1000`\n\nPrompt Example: `cyanotype cat --weird 0`\n\n### Drawing Distinctions: `--weird` vs. `--chaos` vs. `--stylize`\n\n- `--chaos`: Determines the degree of divergence among the initial set of images.\n- `--stylize`: Directs the strength with which Midjourney's signature aesthetic is wielded.\n- `--weird`: Regulates the deviation of an image from the typical Midjourney visual norm.\n\n---\n\n# Prompt Examples\n\n- `a mechanic woman | GTA portrait flat illustration | pastel tones | garage in the background | videogame loading screen; digital 2D --s 180`\n- `a mechanic woman | GTA portrait flat illustration | pastel tones | garage in the background | videogame loading screen; digital 2D --ar 16:9`\n- `scuba diver under the water | national geographic shot | daylight | fishes and corals in the background | award-wining photography --ar 16:9`\n- `a man in elegant suit under the water | GoPro Hero shot | daylight | fishes and corals in the background | award-wining photography --ar 16:9`\n- `sketch drawing by a 5 years child | dog at park | crayons | vivid tones | white notebook`\n- `portrait of Pope Francis | propaganda iconography illustration in monochromatic light red | dark blue background | simple bold lines --s 25`\n- `portrait of Audrey Hepburn | propaganda iconography illustration in monochromatic light red | dark white background | simple bold lines --s 25`\n- `a pair of nike Air Jordan snipes | white and red | empty background | commercial shot --s 750`\n- `ecommerce icons sheet | simple building shapes | white background --s 40`\n- `a screenshot of small village in a cute art game | PS graphics | dynamic anime | new topographics | daylight, red and brown | folklore; animecore --ar 16:9 --s 750`\n- `a cowboy in green attire at a western city | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style full body | cartoonish --ar 2:3 --s 750`\n- `a cowboy in green attire at a western city | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style portraits | cartoonish --ar 1:1 --s 750`\n- `a western desert | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style landscape | cartoonish --ar 16:9 --s 750`\n- `a cowboy in green attire at a western desert | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style action scene | cartoonish --ar 47:20 --s 750`\n- `a cowboy in green attire at a western city | 2d flat illustrations game art | western-style instagram post | cartoonish --ar 9:16 --s 750`\n- `2D scenario of a side-scrolling platformers videogame | pixel art | medieval backdrops | triadic blue palette --s 150 --ar 16:9`\n- `2D scenario of a side-scrolling platformers videogame | pixel art | tropical backdrops | triadic yellow palette --s 150 --ar 16:9`\n\n---\n\n# Your Objective:\n\nTransform basic ideas into detailed, evocative prompts, maximizing Midjourney's potential:\n- Emphasize nouns and adjectives, specifying image content and style.\n- You use the Additive Prompting Technique incorporating the Parameters into it.\n- Pull from the above examples and infuse your creativity step-by-step.\n\n---\n\nHere is your task and my idea:\n\n# Task \n1) Create 2 Midjourney prompts based on the idea, using the additive prompting technique, use Parameters where they fit the goal of the image. Use this output format without naming the framework parts: `[SUBJECT] | [STYLE] | [COLORS] | [BACKGROUND] | [TAGS/EXTRAS]`\n\n# Idea\n[add your idea here]\n\n###"

        "prompt": "In today's society, addictive behaviors and disorders have gained significant attention within the field of psychology. One such disorder is gambling disorder, which has been recognized as a mental health condition with substantial impacts on individuals, their relationships, and society as a whole. In this article, I  will provide a comprehensive overview of gambling disorder, its symptoms, causes, and available treatment options.\n\nGambling disorder, also known as ludomania, is characterized by recurrent and problematic gambling behavior that leads to significant distress or impairment in various areas of an individual's life. It is classified as a behavioral addiction and shares similarities with substance-related disorders.\nTo diagnose gambling disorder, mental health experts utilize specific criteria outlined in the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5). Three common diagnostic criteria include:\n1. Preoccupation with gambling: Feeling a strong urge to engage in gambling activities and constantly thinking about past gambling experiences.\n2. Increasing the frequency and intensity of gambling: The need to gamble with larger amounts of money or for longer periods to experience the same level of excitement or satisfaction.\n3. Failed attempts to control or stop gambling: Repeated unsuccessful attempts to curb or quit gambling, resulting in feelings of helplessness and frustration.\n\nPotential Causes and Risk Factors\nThe etiology of gambling disorder is complex, stemming from a combination of genetic, environmental, and psychological factors. Individuals with a family history of gambling disorder are more susceptible to developing the condition. Other contributing factors may include:\n\n1. Neurochemical imbalances: Certain neurotransmitters, such as dopamine, serotonin, and norepinephrine, play a significant role in regulating mood and reward systems. Imbalances in these neurochemicals may contribute to compulsive gambling behavior.\n2. Psychological vulnerabilities: Individuals who struggle with depression, anxiety, or other mental health disorders may turn to gambling as a coping mechanism or means of escape.\n3. Environmental factors: Social and environmental influences, such as early exposure to gambling, family or peer pressure, and the availability of gambling opportunities, can increase the risk of developing gambling disorder.\n\nImpact on Individuals, Relationships, and Society\nGambling disorder can have far-reaching consequences for individuals and those around them. Some of the effects include:\n1. Financial troubles: Gambling can lead to severe financial difficulties, including debt, bankruptcy, and loss of assets.\n2. Emotional distress: Individuals may experience heightened anxiety, depression, and shame due to the negative impact of their gambling behavior.\n3. Relationship strains: The secrecy, lies, and financial hardships associated with gambling disorder can strain personal relationships, leading to breakdowns in trust, communication, and intimacy.\n4. Legal and criminal issues: In extreme cases, individuals engaging in gambling disorder may resort to illegal activities to fund their addiction, resulting in legal consequences for themselves and others.\n\nTreatment Options and Support Resources\nEffective treatment for gambling disorder typically includes a combination of therapies tailored to the individual's unique needs. Some available treatment options include:\n1. Cognitive-Behavioral Therapy (CBT): This therapeutic approach helps individuals identify and modify unhealthy thought patterns and behaviors associated with gambling.\n2. Support groups: Gamblers Anonymous and other support groups offer a safe and non-judgmental environment for individuals to share their experiences, gain support, and access valuable resources.\n3. Medication: In certain cases, medication may be prescribed to manage underlying mental health conditions contributing to gambling disorder, such as depression or anxiety.\n\nConclusion:\nGambling disorder is a serious mental health condition that can have devastating effects on individuals, relationships, and society. Recognizing the symptoms and seeking timely treatment is crucial in mitigating the harmful consequences associated with this disorder. With proper support and suitable interventions, individuals struggling with gambling disorder can regain control over their lives and forge a path towards recovery and well-being.\n\nRemember, if you or someone you know is dealing with gambling disorder, help is available. Reach out to mental health professionals, helplines, or support groups to start your journey towards a healthier and happier life."
