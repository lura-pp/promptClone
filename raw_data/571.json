It serves as both the economic guardian of enterprises and the messenger of information, providing solid support for the stable development of businesses and external decision-making.\n\nAccounting calculation is like a sophisticated building, constructed from multiple important components. Recording and auditing vouchers are the foundation of this building, providing the basis for recording and verifying economic transactions. Each voucher carries important information about the economic activities of the enterprise, ensuring the authenticity and accuracy of the business.\n\nSetting up accounting subjects and accounts is the framework of the building, laying the foundation for classifying and recording economic transactions. By scientifically and reasonably setting up subjects and accounts, enterprises can clearly organize various economic activities, facilitating subsequent accounting and analysis.\n\nDouble-entry bookkeeping is like the beams and columns of the building, recording equal amounts in two or more interrelated accounts, fully reflecting the ins and outs of economic transactions. This accounting method allows the financial condition of the enterprise to be easily understood, providing comprehensive decision-making basis for managers.\n\nRecording in ledgers categorizes the information from accounting vouchers into books, forming systematic accounting information. The ledger is like the archive room in the building, storing the historical records of the enterprise's economic activities, available for consultation and analysis at any time.\n\nCost calculation is to determine the cost of products or services for enterprises, providing a basis for pricing and decision-making. It is like the calculator in the building, accurately calculating the cost of each product or service, helping enterprises formulate reasonable pricing strategies in the market competition.\n\nAsset inventory is the inventory and verification of the company's assets and materials to ensure that the accounts match the actual assets. This is like conducting a safety inspection of the building, promptly identifying and correcting issues in asset management to ensure the safety and integrity of the company's assets.\n\nPreparing financial statements such as balance sheets, income statements, cash flow statements, etc., is an important outcome of accounting calculation. These statements are like the windows of the building, providing external users such as investors, creditors, and government with information on the financial condition and operating results of the enterprise, enabling them to understand the strength and development prospects of the company.\n\nAccounting supervision is another important function of accounting. It supervises the authenticity, legality, and reasonableness of economic transactions, ensuring that the company's economic activities operate on the right track. It supervises the custody and use of assets, preventing waste and loss of assets. At the same time, it supervises the execution of financial income and expenses, ensuring the rational use of company funds.\n\nIn conclusion, accounting is an indispensable and important component of enterprises. Through rigorous accounting and effective supervision, it safeguards the development of enterprises and provides reliable information support to external stakeholders."
