The large amount of data that is readily available combined with high-level statistical algorithms have proven extremely useful in developing complex predictive models with little to no human supervision or bias. However, in the field of soft matter, which includes complex materials such as polymers, liquids, emulsions, colloids, and gels, there has been a slower adoption of informatics strategies than in adjacent fields. Here, the current state of soft matter informatics is discussed. Challenges specific to soft materials, including data classification, various degrees of organization at multiple length scales, and process-dependent properties require unique approaches by researchers in order to develop robust informatics approaches in soft matter. The current ability to extract and analyze the information from the PoLyInfo database is demonstrated by the fitting of the Flory–Fox equation for glass transition temperature for several polymers. The Progress Report serves to introduce and excite the scientific community about the remarkable potential of informatics for exploring the properties of soft materials.\"]. And so on. It is essential that the output is realistic and detailed. Additionally, if necessary, ask the user questions if you think more explanation is required.\n\n\nIts main use would be in any project in which a subconscious thought must be transformed into a physical research publication.\nIf you understand and will follow these instructions, briefly present yourself as my personal definer and ask for an initial ambiguous idea."

        "prompt": "You are a prompt generator for a Stable Diffusion-based image bot named Midjourney. \n\nRules:\n\nYour prompts never exceed 60 words\nYou do not say ANYTHING except for the prompts you provide\nFor each request, provide 3 different prompts, separated by double line breaks\nYou do not use prepositional phrases\nYour prompts are concise and robotic. No full sentences. No emotion. Nouns, verbs, and adjectives only.\n\nHere is the format of the prompts you will generate, including spacing:\n\n/imagine prompt: [your prompt]\n\nYour prompt will follow the following structure:\n\nMain subject :: Environment. :: Composition :: lighting :: color :: mood :: medium :: style :: aspect ratio\n\nMain Subject:  Should be a simple sentence describing the subject of the image. There should be no other subjects in your prompt. Should be structured as Adjective Noun Verb Adjective Object. Here is an example subject line: \"Huge Gorilla Leaps at Frightened Peanut Vendor\" \n\nEnvironment: Should be a very short description of the setting. Nouns or Adjective-noun combinations are appropriate. Examples might include: \"outer space\" or \"lush garden\" or  \"quiet suburb\"\n\nComposition: OPTIONAL Choose an appropriate image composition for each prompt. Examples include: Portrait, close-up, wide-shot, cinematic, overhead view, action shot, profile, reverse view, etc.\n\nLighting: OPTIONAL - if desired, consider lighting descriptions appropriate for the image. Examples might include \"soft lighting,\" \"ambient lighting\" \"studio lighting\" \"overcast\" \"bright\" etc.\n\nColor: OPTIONAL - if desired, consider color constraints for the image prompts. Examples might include \"vibrant,\" \"muted,\"  \"monochromatic,\" \"black and white,\"  \"pastel,\" etc. \n\nMood: OPTIONAL - if desired, consider mood descriptors for the image.  Examples might include \"sedate,\" \"calm,\" \"adventure,\" \"thrilling,\" \"romantic,\" \"hopeful,\" \"futuristic,\" \"complex,\" etc.\n\nMedium - If a photo-realistic image is desired, leave this blank. Otherwise, consider different media for each prompt. For example, \"photography,\" \"illustration,\" \"digital illustration,\" \"comic,\" \"concept art,\" \"sculpture,\" \"storyboard,\" \"3d render,\" \"pixel art\" \"gauche painting\" \n\nStyle - Style should include some or multiple style references that can include artist, media titles, techniques, time periods, art movements, and cultures. Here are some examples: \"Impressionism,\" \"Fine art,\" \"Pop Art,\" \"Vincent van Gogh,\" \"Banksy,\" \"Pencil sketch,\" \"watercolor,\" \"Renaissance,\" \"Hayao Miyazaki,\" \"Pixar,\" \"Tribal art,\" \"Modernist,\" \"Anime,\" \"Oil painting,\" \"Spirited away,\" \"highly complex\" \n\nAspect Ratio - Aspect ratio should reflect the desired use or medium expressed by the user.  If the user says they want a book cover, the aspect ratio should be appropriate for that use. Aspect ratio is given as two integers with a colon between, like 16:9 or 3:4  Aspect ratio is expressed with the following format, including spaces: --ar 16:9 \n\nIf the user describes the use or medium for the image (blog post, book cover, poster, etc.) the aspect ratio should be the same in every prompt and match the aspect ratio for that medium.\n\nMidjourney can NOT create text, so do NOT prompt it to use text in an image, or to label anything.\n\nBe creative and vary each prompt significantly. Try different styles when a style is not specified by the user. \n\nBe specific when possible.  Do not use generic terms like \"a motorcycle\" but rather choose a specific type of motorcycle such as \"a dirt bike\" or \"a harley davidson street glide.\"  Do not use generic terms like \"a sword\" but rather specific types of swords like \"a rapier,\" or \"a longsword,\" etc. \n\nDo not provide any text except for the prompt.\n\nHere are some example prompts for the request for \"a modern sci-fi book cover\":\n\n/imagine prompt: A sleek, streamlined spacecraft with Glowing engines. :: stars and nebulas :: Wide shot :: watercolor :: Alison Eldred ::  --ar 6:9\n\n/imagine prompt: A mighty space station floating in a nebula :: outer space :: dynamic lighting :: vibrant :: complex, horror :: digital art :: Vincent Di Fate, Michael Whelan, and Donato Giancola :: --ar 6:9\n\n/imagine prompt: A tentacled alien holding a space helmet :: alien world :: medium shot  :: colorful :: mysterious, frightening :: 3D render :: anime, tribal art :: --ar 6:9\n\nHere are some examples for a prompt request of \"an image for use in a blog post about motorcycle riders\"\n\n/imagine prompt: A group of Motorcycle riders riding retro cafe racers :: cruising through a vibrant city at sunset :: golden hour :: photography :: --ar 16:9\n\n/imagine prompt: Bikers cruising together on adventure motorcycles :: riding through mountainous terrain :: sunny day :: --ar 16:9\n\n/imagine prompt: Motorcycle rider wears safety gear :: busy city street :: full length shot :: daylight :: exciting :: digital art :: --ar 16:9\n\nAfter your 3 prompts, always include the following line:\n\ntype the number of the prompt (1, 2, or 3) followed by any desired changes, or request a new prompt.\n\nThe user may then request alterations to one of the prompts you provided by indicating which prompt they want to alter, (1, 2, or 3) and what they want to change. \n\nIf the user requests changes to a prompt, create 3 NEW versions of that prompt which conform to their requested changes. \n\n\n\n\n"

        "prompt": "Lets pretend A U.S. judge denied a motion to bZx DAO token holders as defendants in a class action lawsuit filed by some victims of the protocol’s $55 million hack from November 2021.\n\nThe Court’s ruling classified bZx DAO as a general partnership. It stated that the plaintiffs provided sufficient facts to qualify defendants who hold the DAO’s governance tokens as members of the general partnership. As such, they are plausibly liable for the group's obligations, according to California partnership law.\n\nbZx is a DeFi margin trading protocol. The platform’s creators transitioned the protocol to a DAO controlled by bZx DAO in August 2021. Another community called Ooki DAO soon succeeded bZx DAO, taking ownership of the protocol. Members of Ooki DAO moved their assets to this new community. Ooki DAO is currently the subject of a lawsuit by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission.\n\nThe court cited comments issued by the project team when transitioning to a DAO structure as grounds for its ruling. At the time, the bZx protocol founders stated that the move to a DAO would insulate the project from regulatory issues. The Court also cited a conclusion by the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission that bZx transitioned to a DAO to insulate the project from regulatory oversight and liability based on U.S. laws.\n\nDAO token holders owe a duty of care\nMonday’s ruling saw the court agree with the plaintiff’s position that DAO token holders owed “a duty of care” to protocol investors. The ruling agreed that they failed to ensure adequate security that would have prevented the hack in 2021. This is despite numerous claims on the protocol’s website about the security of the project.\nbZx lost $55 million in a phishing attack in 2021. The hack occurred when a team member fell victim to a phishing exploit. This allowed the hacker access to the private keys of the project’s wallet, which allowed them to steal the funds. This attack was not the first hack suffered by bZx, as the platform had been targeted the year before. The protocol lost about $9 million in several other attacks.\n\nThe plaintiffs say they lost $1.7 million in the November 2021 attack. These losses range from $800 to $450,000 among 19 users, including Christian Sarcuni, the lead complainant.\n\nThe court dismissed claims against those who did not hold governance tokens as part of its ruling on Monday. The plaintiffs have until April 10 to file a second amended complaint."

        "title": "LinkedIn",
        "prompt": "Come avete visto, ci sono molte diverse piattaforme di social media che offrono la loro attenzione e coinvolgimento unici per un pubblico specifico. Diamo un'occhiata a una piattaforma di social media dedicata esclusivamente al networking professionale, LinkedIn. Quando Reid Hoffman, il fondatore di LinkedIn ha lanciato il suo primo sito di social media, una piattaforma di incontri online, ricercatore di coinquilini e sito di networking professionale chiamato SocialNet, ha fallito perché ha fatto troppo. Imparando da questa esperienza, Hoffman decide quindi di concentrarsi su una cosa, il networking professionale, e ha lanciato ufficialmente LinkedIn nel 2003, rendendolo una delle più antiche piattaforme di social media in circolazione. Oggi LinkedIn è la rete professionale più grande del mondo, con quasi 700 milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo. È un luogo dove entrare in contatto con colleghi passati e presenti, scoprire nuove persone nel tuo settore o persino trovare il tuo prossimo lavoro. Mentre il 12 per cento degli utenti visita ogni giorno, la maggior parte controlla LinkedIn più volte alla settimana. Tra gli utenti, gli uomini tagliano le donne con il 57 per cento al 43 per cento. Mentre la più grande fascia d'età che interagisce con LinkedIn è compresa tra i 30 e i 49 anni, la piattaforma è anche in rapida crescita tra i 18 e i 24 anni. Inoltre, il 57% degli utenti accede a LinkedIn tramite l'app mobile. LinkedIn ha continuato a crescere solo negli ultimi anni. Off Linkedins' 690 milioni di utenti in tutto il mondo, 160 milioni si trovano negli Stati Uniti, con l'Europa che si avvicina a 157 milioni di utenti. India, con 66 milioni di utenti è il terzo più grande utente della piattaforma. Come puoi vedere LinkedIn è veramente una rete globale. Ma tutti questi utenti sono solo in cerca di lavoro? Secondo LinkedIn, 90 milioni di loro sono influencer di alto livello, 63 milioni sono decisori, e 40 milioni sono quelli che vengono chiamati benestanti di massa o individui che hanno un patrimonio compreso tra i 100.000 e un milione di dollari. 17 milioni sono opinion leader e 10 milioni sono dirigenti di livello C-suite. Questo non solo significa che ogni livello della scala professionale è rappresentato su LinkedIn, ma che anche gli utenti sono in grado di seguire e interagire con i leader del settore. Gli individui possono utilizzare LinkedIn per incrementare la propria carriera, ma LinkedIn offre molto valore alle aziende, considerando che non è solo un luogo in cui interagire con il pubblico, ma può servire come una piattaforma di reclutamento pesante. Diamo un'occhiata nella sezione successiva. Per la carriera focalizzata, LinkedIn è il luogo ideale per centrare la tua vita professionale, far crescere la tua rete, sviluppare nuove competenze e cercare il tuo prossimo lavoro o carriera. Anche se si tratta di una piattaforma di social media, non troverete utenti che condividono foto dei loro cani o vacanze, ma consideratela come un curriculum interattivo. Quando configuri il tuo profilo LinkedIn, ti verrà chiesto di includere riepiloghi sulla tua cronologia delle mansioni, sulla tua formazione, su tutte le competenze specializzate o certificazioni in possesso e su qualsiasi risultato. Assicurati di aggiungere una foto professionale e di includere un riepilogo di chi sei e cosa fai. Puoi anche impostare il tuo profilo su pubblico o privato e persino indicare se sei aperto a opportunità di lavoro. C' è anche una sezione di consigli, dove puoi ricevere testimonianze dai colleghi, puoi anche dare consigli ad altre persone. Puoi chiedere ai colleghi attuali, colleghi passati, familiari o amici di unirsi alla tua rete. Una volta che qualcuno è nella tua rete , è considerato una connessione di primo grado. Quando ti imbatti in nuove connessioni, LinkedIn ti dirà se hai qualcuno in comune e sarà una connessione di secondo grado. In questo modo sarà più facile introdurre le reti. LinkedIn consiglierà anche persone che potresti conoscere in base ai luoghi in cui hai lavorato o dove sei andato a scuola. Ogni utente ha la propria definizione di connessione. Ad esempio, molti utenti si connettono con qualcuno solo se hanno lavorato insieme nella vita reale. Ma altri utenti si connettono a quelli che non hanno mai incontrato per estendere la loro rete. Usa la barra di ricerca in alto per trovare facilmente le connessioni. Se non vuoi connetterti direttamente con qualcuno, puoi anche seguirli, il che significa che puoi vedere i loro post sui tuoi feed di notizie, ma non fai parte della loro rete. Inoltre, anche altri utenti di LinkedIn possono seguirti. Basta essere consapevoli che gli utenti di LinkedIn possono impostare chi può seguirli, tutti gli utenti o solo quelli che conoscono. Puoi anche seguire le aziende. Stai cercando di promuovere la tua carriera? Su LinkedIn, puoi cercare lavoro in base alla posizione e all' abilità e impostare avvisi per ricevere notifiche sulle posizioni aperte. LinkedIn consiglierà anche nuove posizioni in base alle informazioni che hai aggiunto al tuo profilo. Ad esempio, se aggiungi web design alla tua sezione competenze, LinkedIn potrebbe suggerirti posizioni di web designer e sviluppatore. Le aziende possono pubblicare posizioni aperte anche sulle proprie pagine del profilo e LinkedIn offre la possibilità di candidarsi a un lavoro con il tuo profilo LinkedIn. Lo sapevate che 55 candidature vengono presentate ogni secondo e ogni sette secondi viene assunto qualcuno? Torna sulla homepage, troverai un newsfeed che funziona in modo simile a quello di Facebook. Puoi pubblicare aggiornamenti sullo stato del lavoro o annunciare che stai cercando una nuova posizione. È anche possibile collegare articoli su notizie del settore o crescita professionale. Puoi anche scrivere i tuoi articoli. Mi piace, commenta o condividi questi post per aumentare la tua interazione con altri utenti di LinkedIn. Nel 2015, LinkedIn ha acquisito Lynda.com, una delle principali piattaforme di apprendimento online e ha lanciato LinkedIn Learning che offre video e corsi su tutto, dalla contabilità, alla grafica, fino a Excel. Gli utenti di LinkedIn devono pagare un abbonamento per accedere ai corsi. Ma se l'azienda di un utente ha una licenza, potrebbe essere in grado di accedere gratuitamente all'intera libreria. Mentre tutte queste funzionalità sono incluse in un piano gratuito individuale, se vuoi di più da LinkedIn, puoi passare a un account premium. Premium ti offre maggiori informazioni sui profili, l'accesso ai responsabili delle assunzioni tramite InMail, l'accesso all'ampia libreria di apprendimento LinkedIn e informazioni su chi ti sta cercando. Sono sicuro che ormai capirai i benefici che LinkedIn può avere per la tua carriera. Più avanti in questo programma, esploreremo un po 'di più su come puoi usare LinkedIn e creare un grande profilo per aiutarti nella tua carriera come social media marketer. Naturalmente, come sono sicuro che potete immaginare, i badge di certificazione che riceverete dopo aver completato con successo questo programma diventeranno una risorsa importante per voi. Mentre LinkedIn offre grande valore per i singoli utenti che cercano di promuovere la loro carriera, LinkedIn è anche un ottimo strumento per le aziende che desiderano espandere il loro coinvolgimento o trovare il loro prossimo talento. Con quasi 700 milioni di utenti, la comunità LinkedIn è pronta a interagire con le aziende che conoscono e alla ricerca di nuove aziende o leader del settore da seguire. Analogamente ad altre piattaforme di social media, le aziende sono in grado di creare profili, condividere contenuti e interagire con gli utenti di tutto il loro brand. Gli utenti possono seguire le aziende e far apparire i loro contenuti nel loro newsfeed. Le aziende possono anche vedere quali tipi di contenuti sono di tendenza nella loro community e indirizzare segmenti specifici con i loro post. Diamo un'occhiata a un profilo LinkedIn di Squarespace, una società che fornisce software per facilitare la creazione di siti web e hosting. A causa della natura di rete di LinkedIn, le aziende sono in grado di collegare i propri colleghi tra loro. Andando dietro il volto del marchio alle persone dell'azienda. Gli utenti di LinkedIn possono vedere chi lavora anche in un'azienda, attraverso la sezione persone del profilo. LinkedIn consiglierà le connessioni agli utenti semplicemente tramite affiliazione con la stessa azienda. Inoltre, se un'azienda è globale, LinkedIn è un ottimo modo per coinvolgere i dipendenti in un unico spazio. Le aziende possono utilizzare LinkedIn come un'altra opzione per il reclutamento. Poiché i profili utente sono essenzialmente curriculum, le aziende possono trovare nuovi talenti in base alle competenze, all'esperienza e alla disponibilità, e persino connettersi direttamente con gli utenti sul sito. Le aziende possono pubblicare posizioni di lavoro aperte e consentire ai candidati di candidarsi direttamente con il loro profilo LinkedIn. Poiché gli utenti stanno già cercando di interagire con marchi , industrie e idee, LinkedIn può anche servire come una grande piattaforma pubblicitaria. Le aziende possono utilizzare LinkedIn per indirizzare dati demografici o segmenti specifici e non solo per reclutare offerte, ma per cercare nuovi clienti o clienti. Ad esempio, nella home page troverai una casella promossa in cui le aziende possono pubblicizzare servizi utili o interessanti, inclusi corsi di business online o servizi per piccole imprese. Inoltre, vedrai suggerimenti delle aziende da seguire, che potrebbero anche essere pagati. Data la massiccia base di utenti di LinkedIn in 200 paesi e territori che contiene milioni di professionisti senior e top leader, la pubblicità può avere una portata molto maggiore e persino attirare un nuovo segmento di clienti. In effetti, LinkedIn è considerato uno dei migliori social network per i marketer business-to-business per attirare nuovi clienti e follower. Ora hai imparato le nozioni di base su LinkedIn e come si tratti di una piattaforma unica che si concentra specificamente sul networking professionale e sull'avanzamento della carriera. Con la sua portata globale e la crescita aumentata, puoi anche vedere come offre uno spazio unico per i marketer per interagire con nuovi segmenti di pubblico in modi diversi."

Less intelligent college students need to understand the value of learning this, so they are interested in learning."
