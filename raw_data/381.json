        "title": "Four-tuple annotation for aspect-level sentiment analysis",
        "prompt": "Task: Analyze a restaurant review and select the most suitable pseudo-label from the provided options (only codename required). If the review is unrelated to the restaurant (e.g., about beauty salon, medical, repair, or hotel), select **\"Irrelevant Domain\"**. If no option fits, including cases where the review doesn't express any sentiment or the sentiment is unclear, choose **\"No Sentiment or No Appropriate Option\"**.\n\nUnderstand the Pseudo-label Components:\n- Aspect Category: Consists of an entity label and attribute label, where the **entity** specifies the object (e.g., \"FOOD\", \"SERVICE\", \"AMBIENCE\"), and the **attribute** specifies the characteristic (e.g., \"GENERAL\", \"STYLE_OPTIONS\"). These combinations indicate specific aspects, such as `{SERVICE#GENERAL}`, `{FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS}`. Categories must match the entity and attribute spaces as defined in the ABSA guidelines.\n- Sentiment Polarity: Indicates the sentiment as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. Neutral is used for mild sentiments that do not convey strong opinion (e.g., \"Food was okay, nothing great\"). Negative or positive sentiments should be assigned only if a clear preference or dissatisfaction is expressed.\n\n- Aspect Term: The specific term in the review text that refers to the aspect. For explicit mentions, use the word directly, such as \"food\" or \"service\". If the aspect is implied rather than directly stated, use **\"NULL\"** to indicate an inferred reference.\n- Opinion Term: The words or phrases expressing sentiments in the review. If the sentiment is implied without explicit sentiment-bearing words, use **\"NULL\"**. This term should reflect clear sentiment words (e.g., \"excellent\", \"slow\", \"bad\").\n\nKey Points to Remember:\n1. Relevance Check: Before proceeding, ensure that the review is relevant to restaurant aspects and expresses a sentiment. If it is not, select \"Irrelevant Domain.\"\n2. Aspect Matching: If multiple aspects are discussed, try to match each sentiment with the appropriate aspect based on context (e.g., \"Service was slow, but the food was delicious\" requires separate labels for SERVICE and FOOD aspects).\n3. Sentiment Strength: For weak or vague sentiments, use \"neutral\". Only assign \"positive\" or \"negative\" if there is a clear sentiment direction.\n4. Multiple Sentiment Expressions: If a sentence contains multiple sentiments towards the same aspect, choose the sentiment that best represents the reviewer's overall tone.\n\nExamples for Reference:\n1. Review: \"The wait time was long, but the food was worth it.\"\n   - Pseudo-label options:\n     - {SERVICE#GENERAL, negative, \"wait time\", \"long\"}\n     - {FOOD#QUALITY, positive, \"food\", \"worth it\"}\n   \n2. Review: \"The ambiance was cozy, but the portions were small.\"\n   - Pseudo-label options:\n     - {AMBIENCE#GENERAL, positive, \"ambiance\", \"cozy\"}\n     - {FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, negative, \"portions\", \"small\"}\n\nYour Task:\nFor each review, select the best pseudo-label that captures the sentiment, aspect category, aspect term, and opinion term. Provide your answer as follows:\n{\n  \"Rationale\": \"Your detailed rationale for selecting the best choice, explaining the sentiment, aspect, and opinion match.\",\n  \"Best Choice\": \"The pseudo-label you chose\",\n  \"Confidence\": \"Your confidence level (1-5)\"\n}\n\nExample Task:\n1. Review: \"There was only 1 time that food came in under a half hour.\"\n   - Pseudo-label options:\n     - A. {SERVICE#GENERAL, negative, \"NULL\", \"NULL\"}\n     - B. {FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, negative, \"food\", \"NULL\"}\n     - C. {SERVICE#GENERAL, neutral, \"NULL\", \"NULL\"}\n     - D. {FOOD#STYLE_OPTIONS, neutral, \"food\", \"NULL\"}\n"
