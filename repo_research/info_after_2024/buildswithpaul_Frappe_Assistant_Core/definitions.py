⚠️ CRITICAL REQUIREMENT: Administrator has enforced artifact streaming for analysis operations.

📋 ADMINISTRATOR CONFIGURATION:
{custom_instructions}

⚡ AUTOMATIC ENFORCEMENT:
The server detects substantial analysis results and enforces artifact streaming by:
- Providing summary and redirection when large results detected
- Requiring re-execution in artifact workspace for complete results
- Ensuring unlimited analysis depth through artifact streaming

🎯 ARTIFACT STREAMING TRIGGERS:
- Line threshold: {streaming_manager.get_line_threshold()}+ lines
- Character threshold: {streaming_manager.get_char_threshold():,}+ characters
- Analysis tools: enforce_artifact_streaming = {streaming_manager.should_enforce_streaming()}
- Response limit prevention: {streaming_manager.should_prevent_response_limits()}

✅ BENEFITS OF CONFIGURED APPROACH:
- Eliminates response limit errors completely
- Professional deliverable creation guaranteed
- Unlimited analytical depth ensured
- Stakeholder-ready outputs automatic

This protocol ensures reliable, unlimited analysis capabilities through intelligent artifact streaming."""
