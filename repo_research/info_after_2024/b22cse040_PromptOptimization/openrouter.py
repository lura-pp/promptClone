  """
  Calls the OpenRouter API with a given prompt and handles retries with
  exponential backoff and random jitter.

  This fn is designed to be resilient to transient network issues and temporary
  API unavailability.

  Args:
     prompt (str): The user's prompt to send to the LLM.
     llm_name (str): The model identifier on OpenROuter (e.g., 'meta-llama/llama-3-8b-instruct').
                        Defaults to a fast and capable model.
     retries (int): The maximum number of times to retry the request if it fails.
     backoff (float): The base time in seconds for the backoff delay. The delay
                              increases exponentially with each retry.

  Returns:
    str: The response from the OpenRouter API. (Note: Although some prompts would ask for
    JSON output, use clean_response to achieve JSON output.)

  Raises:
    ValueError: If the OPENROUTER_API_KEY environment variable is not set.
    Exception: If the request fails after all retry attempts.
