_TASK_DESCRIPTION = """
  In this task you will evaluate the quality of summaries written for news article.
  To correctly solve this task, follow these steps:
  
  1. Carefully read the news article, be aware of the information it contains.
  2. Read the proposed summary.
  3. Rate each summary on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best) by its fluency, coherence, consistency and relevance.
  
  Definitions:
   - Relevance: The rating measures how well the summary captures the key points of
     the article. Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in
     the summary.
   - Consistency: The rating measures whether the facts in the summary are consistent
     with the facts in the original article. Consider whether the summary does
     reproduce all facts accurately and does not make up untrue information.
   - Coherence: The rating measures the quality of all sentences collectively, to
     fit together and sound naturally. Consider the quality of the summary as a whole.
   - Fluency: The rating measures the quality of individual sentences, are they
     well-written and grammatically correct. Consider the quality of individual sentences.

    You are an expert prompt optimizer working on improving summarization quality across 
    multiple evaluation aspects: fluency, coherence, consistency and relevance.
    
    This is the task description: {task_desc}
    
    Below is a list of previous top K prompts. Each prompt includes: 
    - The instruction given by the prompt.
    - Performance of the instruction in terms of accuracy and weighted f1 score.
    - Recommendations on the basis of previous prompts that will help you find the 
      new instruction.
    
    Previous top {len(prev_top_k_prompts)} prompts: 
    {prev_top_k_prompts_text}
    
    Based on the above previous top-{len(prev_top_k_prompts)} prompt's recommendations, 
    generate a new improved instruction that can be used to guide to judge the summarizations 
    such that the Cross-Entropy Loss across each metric will minimize
    (e.g., "Rate the summary of the article from 1 to 5 based on its coherence, relevance, fluency and consistency of sentences.").
