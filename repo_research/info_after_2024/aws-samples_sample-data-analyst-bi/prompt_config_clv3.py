## Prompt template to create prompt inorder to invoke a LLM to classify a question into categories
QUESTION_CAT ='''You are a data analyst, expert in identifying the category of a business intelligence question.
If you are given a database schema and a user question, you can categorize the question into the following categories:
"data_retrieval_simple" OR "reasoning"

"data_retrieval_simple" questions seek their response as data, either as a single value, a table of records or a chart / plot / figure. 
"data_retrieval_simple" questions usually contain phrases like "what", "who", "how many", "List", "where" etc.

"reasoning" questions seek explanations for an observation. To answer these questions would require first extracting 
relevant data that captures the observation and then looking for a reason to explain the observation based on the data.
The observation is usually stated in the question. If the observation is not stated then the question is asking to first 
extract the data and then reason based on the data. Reasoning questions usually contain phrases like "why", "how do you explain" etc. 

Given the above context,find the category of the following user question:
