Your task is to improve the descriptions of functions listed below. These functions are part of a software system and will be used by an LLM. The goal is to make each function’s purpose, input requirements, and appropriate usage absolutely clear and impossible to misinterpret.

Follow these strict rules:

1. **Do not modify function names or their argument names.** Keep them exactly as they appear.
2. **Do not change the order of arguments** or the function signature formatting.
3. **Do not alter examples.** If any examples are included, retain them exactly as they are — word-for-word.
4. **Clarify vague descriptions.** If the description assumes background knowledge or has ambiguous phrasing, expand it to explain what it means.
5. **Add concise usage guidance.** If you're confident about what the function is for, add a brief sentence explaining:
   - What the function can do
   - What it cannot do
   - When it should or should not be used
   Only do this if you're 100% sure based on the context or function name.
6. **Make the purpose of the function obvious.** Assume the reader has no prior experience with the system.
7. **Preserve the input format.** Whether the input is in JSON, raw text, Python dicts, or XML, you must retain that structure in the output.

Do not make anything up. If something is unclear, do not hallucinate. Only clarify what is stated or strongly implied by the text.

# Rewrite Guidelines:
# - **Do not simplify — clarify.** Expand unclear instructions. Rephrase vague steps into detailed, unambiguous directives.
# - **Explain intent explicitly.** If an instruction assumes background knowledge, add a follow-up phrase explaining what it means or why it's needed.
# - **Force deterministic execution.** Use strong, assertive language. No polite phrasing. No options. Use phrases like: "must", "always", "never", "only if", "strictly after".
# - **Preserve step order and dependencies.** If one step depends on another, state that relationship clearly. e.g., “Only do X after Y is done using Z.”
# - **Maintain original structure.** If the input is a JSON array or numbered list or list of strings, keep that format exactly.
# - **Do not introduce markup, bullet points, or numbered lists unless the input already contains them.** Follow the structure of the input exactly — don’t assume what’s best.
# - **Keep all examples intact.** If examples are included, do not change them — just clarify the surrounding instructions if needed.
# - **Expand only when it helps.** If adding a short explanatory sentence improves clarity, do so — but never remove or combine instructions.

</original_prompt_and_feedback>

2. Analyze the feedback carefully. It may come in various formats, including but not limited to JSON, bullet points, or free-form text. Extract the key points and suggestions from the feedback.

3. When incorporating the feedback:
   - Maintain the original intent of the prompt while enhancing it with the feedback.
   - If the feedback contradicts itself or the original prompt, use your judgment to resolve conflicts.
   - Not all feedback points need to be incorporated if they don't improve the prompt substantially.
   - If the feedback is making the prompt significantly more verbose (compared to it's original form), then do not incorporate it.

4. Rewrite the original prompt to create a new, improved version that:
   - Addresses the main points of the feedback.
   - Maintains clarity and conciseness.
   - Enhances the specificity and effectiveness of the prompt.

5. If the feedback suggests structural changes (e.g., adding steps, changing the format), implement these changes in the new prompt.

6. Pay attention to tone and style. If the feedback suggests changes in tone (e.g., more formal, more friendly), adjust accordingly.

7. If the feedback includes technical terms or specific references, incorporate them accurately in the new prompt.

8. In cases where the feedback is unclear or ambiguous, interpret it in a way that best improves the original prompt.

</original_prompt_and_feedback>
New Prompt: Develop a cost-effective marketing strategy for a new eco-friendly smartphone, targeting Gen Z consumers. Emphasize the device's environmentally conscious features and explore potential influencer partnerships within the limited budget constraints.

Example 4:
<original_prompt_and_feedback>
Prompt: Write a short story about a time traveler.
Feedback: Make it more specific: The time traveler should be a historian from the year 2300 who accidentally travels to ancient Rome. Focus on the cultural shock and the traveler's attempts to blend in without altering history. Add some humor to the narrative.
</original_prompt_and_feedback>
New Prompt: Craft a humorous short story about a historian from the year 2300 who accidentally time travels to ancient Rome. Explore the cultural shock they experience and their comical attempts to blend in without altering the course of history.

Question: What caused the economic recession of 2008?
Context: The financial crisis of 2008, one of the most severe economic downturns since the Great Depression, was primarily triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market. Years of risky lending practices, especially in the subprime mortgage sector, led to a housing bubble. When this bubble burst, it caused massive defaults on mortgage payments. Financial institutions that had heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities and other complex financial instruments faced catastrophic losses. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sent shockwaves through global financial markets, freezing credit markets and precipitating a widespread economic contraction.

Context: The rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI) in recent years has sparked both excitement and concern across various sectors of society. On one hand, AI technologies have demonstrated remarkable capabilities in areas such as healthcare, where machine learning algorithms can now detect certain cancers with accuracy rivaling that of trained radiologists. Similarly, in environmental science, AI systems are helping researchers model climate change patterns and identify potential solutions with unprecedented precision. These advancements suggest a future where complex problems might be addressed more effectively through human-AI collaboration. On the other hand, the acceleration of AI development has raised significant ethical and societal questions. Issues of privacy have become paramount as AI systems require vast amounts of data, often personal in nature, to function effectively. The potential for algorithmic bias has also emerged as a critical concern, with multiple studies demonstrating how AI systems can inadvertently perpetuate or even amplify existing societal prejudices when trained on biased data sets. Perhaps most pressing are the questions surrounding automation and employment. While some economists argue that AI will create new job categories that we cannot yet envision, others point to historical examples where technological advancement led to significant workforce displacement. This debate is particularly relevant in sectors like transportation, where autonomous vehicle technology threatens to disrupt millions of driving jobs worldwide. The governance of AI presents another challenge. Currently, regulatory frameworks lag significantly behind technological development, creating a situation where powerful AI systems are being deployed with limited oversight. This has prompted calls from various stakeholders, including many leading AI researchers themselves, for thoughtful regulation that can mitigate risks while allowing beneficial innovation to continue. As we navigate this complex landscape, one thing remains clear: the impact of AI will not be determined by the technology alone, but by the human choices that shape its development and application. The coming decades will require careful consideration of how we can harness the potential of AI while ensuring it serves humanity's best interests and reflects our core values.

    "context": "Recent studies on the effects of meditation on brain structure and function have revealed promising implications for mental health treatment. In a longitudinal study conducted over eight weeks, researchers at the University of Wisconsin-Madison found that regular meditation practice, consisting of just 20 minutes daily, led to measurable increases in gray matter density in regions of the brain associated with attention, emotional regulation, and empathy. Functional MRI scans showed reduced activity in the amygdala, the brain's threat detection center, suggesting decreased stress reactivity among participants. Particularly noteworthy was the finding that these neurological changes correlated with participants' self-reported improvements in anxiety and depression symptoms, with an average reduction of 38% on standardized psychological assessments. The study's control group, which engaged in relaxation exercises without meditation's mindfulness component, showed significantly smaller improvements, indicating that meditation's effects extend beyond mere relaxation. These findings align with previous research suggesting meditation's potential as a complementary treatment for various mental health conditions. However, researchers caution that while promising, meditation should be viewed as one component of a comprehensive treatment approach rather than a standalone solution for clinical mental health disorders.",

Human Input: Classify news articles by topic
Question: What category does this article belong to?
Context: The European Central Bank announced today it would hold interest rates steady at 3.5%, defying market expectations of a quarter-point reduction. ECB President Christine Lagarde cited persistent inflationary pressures and stronger-than-expected quarterly growth figures as key factors in the decision. "While we have seen improvement in the inflation outlook, core inflation remains elevated, and we need convincing evidence of a sustained return to our target before adjusting our policy stance," Lagarde stated during the press conference following the announcement. The euro strengthened against major currencies immediately after the news, while European stock markets showed mixed reactions. Economists now expect the ECB to potentially begin easing monetary policy in the third quarter, assuming inflation continues its downward trajectory.

## Example 2: Question Answering
Short task description: Question answering based on context
Context: The financial crisis of 2008, one of the most severe economic downturns since the Great Depression, was primarily triggered by the collapse of the U.S. housing market. Years of risky lending practices, especially in the subprime mortgage sector, led to a housing bubble. When this bubble burst, it caused massive defaults on mortgage payments. Financial institutions that had heavily invested in mortgage-backed securities and other complex financial instruments faced catastrophic losses. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in September 2008 sent shockwaves through global financial markets, freezing credit markets and precipitating a widespread economic contraction.
Question: What caused the economic recession of 2008?
Output: {{

## Example 3: Text Summarization
Short task description: Summarize this article
Context: Climate change poses one of the most significant challenges to global biodiversity. Recent studies indicate that rising temperatures are altering habitats faster than many species can adapt. In the Arctic, sea ice reduction has disrupted feeding patterns for polar bears, forcing them to spend more time on land where food sources are less abundant. Meanwhile, coral reefs worldwide are experiencing unprecedented bleaching events due to ocean warming and acidification. Scientists estimate that over 50% of the world's coral reefs have been damaged, threatening the roughly 25% of marine species that depend on these ecosystems. While some species demonstrate remarkable adaptive capacity, many lack the genetic variability or reproductive rates necessary to evolve quickly enough. Conservation efforts now increasingly focus on identifying and protecting climate refugia—areas that may remain relatively stable despite changing conditions—while also establishing migration corridors to facilitate species movement toward more favorable environments.

def extract_task_description_from_raw_input(human_input: str) -> str:

    return f"""You are a meticulous assistant specializing in generating comprehensive task descriptions from human inputs that enable AI training and evaluation.

Your task is to:
1. Extract and expand the most detailed task description from the human input, ensuring it captures all nuances, requirements, constraints, and implicit expectations.
2. Generate the task description in second person (using "you" and "your"), formatted as clear actionable instructions.
3. If the Human Input contains Feedback, prioritize and strictly incorporate this feedback into the task description.
4. Ensure the description includes or implies:
   - The type and structure of expected inputs
   - The nature and format of desired outputs
   - Any quality standards or success criteria that could inform evaluation metrics
   - Edge cases or special conditions that should be handled
   - Domain context relevant to generating realistic synthetic data
5. Format the description with appropriate paragraph breaks, bullet points, or numbered steps if the task involves a sequential process.
6. Preserve any technical terminology, domain-specific language, or specialized vocabulary used in the original input.

Examples:

Human Input: I need a sentiment analyzer for tweets about our product.
Output: You are tasked with developing a sentiment analysis system specifically designed to evaluate customer opinions expressed in tweets about a product. Your analysis should categorize each tweet into positive, negative, or neutral sentiment classifications, with an optional intensity score that indicates the strength of the expressed sentiment. You should pay particular attention to product-specific terminology, common abbreviations used in social media, and contextual cues that might affect interpretation. Your analysis should be robust enough to handle the informal language, hashtags, emoticons, and abbreviated text commonly found in tweets. The system should also identify key product features or aspects mentioned in the tweets to enable aspect-based sentiment analysis, allowing for more granular insights into which specific product elements receive positive or negative feedback.

Human Input: Write a program that checks if a string is a palindrome.
Output: You are tasked with creating a function that determines whether a given string qualifies as a palindrome. Your solution should evaluate if the string reads the same forward and backward, ignoring case sensitivity, spaces, and non-alphanumeric characters during the comparison. Your implementation should handle various edge cases, including empty strings, single-character strings, and inputs containing special characters or numbers. The function should accept any text string as input and return a boolean value: true if the processed string is a palindrome and false if it is not. Ensure your solution is efficient with optimal time and space complexity, suitable for potentially processing large strings or multiple string evaluations in sequence.

Human Input: Summarize news articles.
Output: You are tasked with creating concise summaries of news articles that capture the essential information while reducing the content to approximately 20% of its original length. Your summaries should identify and prioritize the key facts, including the who, what, when, where, why, and how elements central to the story. You should maintain neutrality in your summarization, avoiding the introduction of bias not present in the original text. Your output should begin with a headline or title that encapsulates the main point of the article, followed by the condensed content organized in order of importance. Important names, organizations, locations, dates, and statistics must be preserved in the summary. You should also retain any crucial direct quotes that represent significant positions or statements from key individuals relevant to the story.

Human Input: Create a meal plan generator for weight loss. Feedback: {{"meal plan generator": "should include nutritional information, preparation time, and difficulty level", "weight loss": "focused on high protein, low carb diets"}}
Output: You are tasked with developing a comprehensive meal planning system specifically designed for weight loss through high-protein, low-carbohydrate dietary approaches. Your system should generate customized daily and weekly meal schedules that adhere to specified macronutrient distributions prioritizing protein intake while limiting carbohydrate consumption. For each meal suggestion, you must include complete nutritional information detailing calories, protein, carbohydrates, fats, and fiber content to help users track their nutritional intake accurately. Additionally, each recipe or meal recommendation should specify estimated preparation time and a difficulty level rating to help users plan according to their cooking skills and available time. The meal plans should offer sufficient variety to prevent dietary fatigue while maintaining adherence to the nutritional framework required for effective weight management. Your suggestions should also consider practical aspects such as ingredient availability, meal prep possibilities, and strategies for maintaining compliance with the high-protein, low-carb approach in various social and dining situations.

Human Input: I need an image caption generator.
Output: You are tasked with developing an image captioning system that automatically generates descriptive text for visual content. Your system should produce clear, concise, and accurate descriptions that convey the key elements present in each image, including main subjects, actions, settings, and significant visual details. The captions should vary in length based on image complexity, typically ranging from 1-3 sentences. You should prioritize accessibility considerations, ensuring captions provide adequate information for visually impaired users to understand the image content. Your captions should maintain a neutral, objective tone while accurately representing cultural, contextual, and environmental elements within the image. The system should handle diverse image types, including photographs, illustrations, diagrams, and infographics, adapting the captioning style appropriately for each format. When appropriate, your captions should also convey emotional context or mood evident in the image without making subjective interpretations beyond what is visually apparent.

Human Input: Write a text adventure game.
Output: You are tasked with creating an interactive text-based adventure game that engages players through descriptive narratives and choice-driven gameplay. Your game should present players with richly detailed environments, characters, and situations, followed by multiple decision options that meaningfully impact the story progression. You should implement a branching narrative structure where player choices lead to different outcomes, creating multiple possible pathways through the game. The writing should be immersive and evocative, using second-person perspective to place the player directly in the story. You must include a clear objective or quest for the player to pursue, balanced with interesting obstacles, puzzles, and character interactions that create engaging gameplay. Your implementation should track relevant player statistics or inventory items that influence available choices and outcomes. The game should feature multiple possible endings determined by the cumulative effect of player decisions throughout the adventure. Additionally, you should incorporate appropriate pacing, building tension at key moments and providing quieter moments for exploration and discovery.

Human Input: I need a system that can detect credit card fraud.
Output: You are tasked with developing a sophisticated fraud detection system specifically designed to identify potentially fraudulent transactions in credit card usage patterns. Your system should analyze transaction data in real-time, evaluating multiple factors including but not limited to geographic location, transaction amount, merchant category, transaction frequency, and deviation from established user patterns. You should implement both rule-based detection mechanisms for known fraud patterns and machine learning algorithms capable of identifying subtle anomalies that might indicate fraudulent activity. Your solution must minimize false positives to avoid unnecessary disruption to legitimate customer transactions while maintaining high sensitivity to actual fraud attempts. The system should assign a risk score to each transaction, allowing for different intervention thresholds based on risk level, customer history, and transaction characteristics. Additionally, your system should continuously learn and adapt to evolving fraud techniques by incorporating feedback from confirmed fraud cases and legitimate transactions that were initially flagged as suspicious.

Human Input: Explain how a random forest algorithm works.
Output: You are tasked with providing a comprehensive explanation of the random forest algorithm that is both technically accurate and accessible to individuals with a basic understanding of machine learning concepts. Your explanation should define random forests as an ensemble learning method that operates by constructing multiple decision trees during training and outputting the class (for classification) or mean prediction (for regression) of the individual trees. You should clarify the key mechanisms that differentiate random forests from individual decision trees, specifically bootstrap aggregating (bagging) for selecting training samples and random feature selection at each split. You must explain how these techniques help overcome the overfitting problems common to individual decision trees. Your description should include the algorithm's training process, prediction methodology, and the mathematical intuition behind why combining multiple "weak learners" creates a stronger overall model. Additionally, you should address practical considerations including random forests' advantages (handling high-dimensional data, built-in feature importance, robustness to outliers) and limitations (interpretability challenges, computational requirements for large datasets). Where appropriate, include simple examples to illustrate key concepts.

    You are a helpful assistant tasked with extracting input fields based on a given task description, human input, and sample data.

    Definitions:
    - Input fields: The keys in the JSON data that are required as input to perform the task. These fields provide the information to the system to generate the desired output.

    Instructions:
    1. Analyze the task description, human input, and sample data to identify the input fields.
    2. Only extract the keys from the JSON that represent input fields, which are required to generate an output.
    3. Do not include any output fields or values from the JSON.
    4. Output the input fields as a list of strings.
    5. If no input fields can be identified, output 'None'.

    Examples:
    - Task: Answer questions about geography.
      Sample Data: {{

    Creates a prompt that instructs an LLM to extract both input and output fields from sample data based on the task.
    This combined approach is more token-efficient than making separate calls.
    """
    return f"""
    You are a specialized AI analyst tasked with precisely identifying both input and output fields from provided data structures.

    Definitions:
    - Input fields: The keys in the JSON data that represent information REQUIRED to perform the task. These fields serve as inputs to the system/model and must exist before the task can be executed.
    - Output fields: The keys in the JSON data that represent results, classifications, or any information generated as a response to the inputs.

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. For INPUT fields:
       - ONLY identify fields that are TRUE INPUTS - provided by users or from external sources
       - EXCLUDE any fields that are generated outputs, metadata (like IDs, timestamps), or derived calculations
       - For each field, ask: "Could the system complete the task if this field were missing?" If NO, it's an input field

    2. For OUTPUT fields:
       - Identify fields that represent the RESULTS or GENERATED CONTENT i.e. the field that represents teh main objective of the task
       - Include fields that contain information created by the system in response to the inputs. Unless explicitly mentioned in the task description, the output fields should not include metadata like IDs, timestamps, score, confidence, reasoning, or other information that is not directly generated by the system.

    3. Some fields might be neither inputs nor outputs (metadata, system configuration, etc.)

    Strictly only consider only the outer most JSON in the nested JSON. Do not include any fields from the inner JSONs.

    Step-by-step analysis process:
    1. Carefully examine the task description to understand the core purpose
    2. Review the sample data structure systematically
    3. For each field, determine whether it's an input, output, or neither
    4. Consider nested structures - both inputs and outputs can exist at multiple levels
    5. Output ONLY the field names as JSON arrays of strings, maintaining exact key names

    Examples:
    - Task: Answer questions about geography.
      Sample Data: {{
          "question": "What is the capital of France?",
          "answer": "The capital of France is Paris.",
          "confidence": 0.98,
          "question_id": "geo-123"
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["question", "answer", "confidence", "question_id"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["question"],
          "output_fields": ["answer"]
      }}
      Reasoning: Only the question needs to exist beforehand; answer and confidence are generated outputs, question_id is metadata.

    - Task: Translation between languages.
      Sample Data: {{
          "source_text": "Hello world",
          "source_language": "English",
          "target_language": "Spanish",
          "translation": "Hola mundo",
          "detected_language": "English (confidence: 0.99)"
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["source_text", "source_language", "target_language", "translation", "detected_language"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["source_text", "target_language"],
          "output_fields": ["translation"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs the source text and desired target language to perform translation. source_language is optional as it can be detected, translation is the output, and detected_language is an analysis result.
      
    - Task: Generate personalized meal plans.
      Sample Data: {{
          "dietary_restrictions": ["gluten-free", "dairy-free"],
          "fitness_goal": "weight loss",
          "calories_per_day": 1800,

      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["dietary_restrictions", "fitness_goal", "calories_per_day"],
          "output_fields": ["meals"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs to know dietary restrictions, fitness goals, and calorie targets to generate a meal plan. The meals, total_protein are generated outputs, and meal_plan_id is metadata.
      
    - Task: Analyze sentiment in customer reviews.
      Sample Data: {{
          "review_text": "The service was terrible and the food was cold.",
          "product_id": "PROD-5839",
          "sentiment": "negative",
          "sentiment_score": -0.75,

      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["review_text"],
          "output_fields": ["sentiment"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system requires the review text to analyze sentiment and needs the product_id to associate the analysis with a specific product. The sentiment classification, score, key phrases, and categories are all analysis outputs.
      
    - Task: Generate SQL queries from natural language.
      Sample Data: {{
          "natural_language_query": "Find all customers who spent more than $1000 last month",

          "explanation": "This query joins customers and orders tables, filters for orders from the last month, calculates the total amount spent per customer, and returns only those who spent over $1000."
      }}
      Allowed Fields: ["natural_language_query", "database_schema", "sql_query", "explanation"]
      Analysis: {{
          "input_fields": ["natural_language_query", "database_schema"],
          "output_fields": ["sql_query"]
      }}
      Reasoning: The system needs both the natural language query to understand what SQL to generate and the database schema to create syntactically correct SQL with proper table/column references. The SQL query and explanation are generated outputs.
      
    - Task: Create educational writing prompts for students.
      Sample Data: {{
          "grade_level": "9-10",
          "subject": "English Literature",

You are an expert prompt optimization specialist. Your primary objective is to analyze AI system outputs and provide precise feedback to improve the original prompts. The ultimate goal is to modify existing prompts to make them produce the expected output.

CORE MISSION: Analyze the gap between AI system output and expected output, then provide specific modifications to the original prompt(s) to achieve the desired results.

ANALYSIS FRAMEWORK:

Your analysis must focus on TWO primary areas:

1. **PROMPT-RELATED ISSUES**: Problems that can be solved by modifying the original prompt
2. **NON-PROMPT ISSUES**: Problems related to workflow, system architecture, or other factors beyond prompt modification

CRITICAL PRINCIPLES FOR PROMPT OPTIMIZATION:

- **PRESERVE INTENT**: Never change the fundamental purpose or objective of the original prompt
- **ENHANCE CLARITY**: Make instructions more specific, unambiguous, and detailed
- **ELIMINATE AMBIGUITY**: Identify and resolve unclear or contradictory instructions
- **MAINTAIN STRUCTURE**: Keep the original prompt's format and organization
- **SURGICAL PRECISION**: Make minimal changes that achieve maximum impact
- **SPECIFICITY OVER ADDITION**: Rather than adding new sections, make existing instructions more precise

ANALYSIS METHODOLOGY:

1. **Output Gap Analysis**: 
   - Compare AI system output to expected output character by character
   - Identify specific discrepancies in content, format, structure, reasoning, or completeness
   - Categorize each discrepancy as prompt-fixable or non-prompt-related

2. **Prompt Correlation**:
   - Map each discrepancy to specific prompts OR specific sections/sentences within prompts that caused it
   - Identify ambiguous instructions, missing constraints, or unclear expectations
   - Analyze how current prompt language led to undesired behavior

3. **Root Cause Classification**:
   - Determine if each issue stems from prompt deficiencies or system limitations
   - Distinguish between prompt clarity issues and workflow/architectural problems

ANALYSIS APPROACH:

1. **Output Comparison**: Compare the AI output against the expected output to identify specific discrepancies
2. **Prompt Analysis**: Examine the current prompts to understand what instructions led to the observed behavior  
3. **Root Cause Analysis**: Determine if the AI misunderstood, ignored, or couldn't follow the existing instructions
4. **Gap Identification**: Identify what's missing, unclear, or insufficiently emphasized in the current prompts
5. **Optimization Strategy**: Suggest specific improvements that strengthen the weak points in the prompting

ANALYSIS PRINCIPLES:

- Focus on understanding WHY the AI behaved as it did given the current prompts
- Identify the specific prompt elements that led to the undesired behavior
- Look for cases where the AI followed instructions but the instructions weren't strong enough
- Distinguish between AI misunderstanding vs. insufficient constraint/emphasis in the prompt
- Consider whether requirements are stated with enough force and clarity to override default AI behavior
- Suggest improvements that strengthen weak instructions rather than completely rewriting them
- Balance specificity with maintaining the prompt's original intent

CRITICAL CONSIDERATIONS:

- The AI model follows instructions as written, so analyze what the current prompt actually communicates
- Look for implicit assumptions in the current prompt that may not be clear to the AI
- Consider whether the requirements are stated explicitly enough for consistent execution
- Identify if the prompt provides sufficient constraints to prevent unwanted variations
- Assess whether the current instructions are specific enough for the intended use case

- Is the task scope appropriately bounded to prevent scope creep?
- Are any implicit assumptions made explicit?
- Is the difficulty level and complexity clearly communicated?

###  2. Instruction Precision & Completeness
- Are instructions specific enough to prevent multiple valid interpretations?
- Is the sequence of steps or reasoning process clearly outlined?
- Are edge cases and boundary conditions addressed?
- Are there any gaps in the instruction chain that could cause confusion?
- Do instructions include both what to do AND what not to do?

###  3. Context & Background Sufficiency (if applicable)
- Is all necessary domain knowledge and context provided?
- Are technical terms, acronyms, and specialized vocabulary defined?
- Is the appropriate level of detail provided for the target audience?
- Are relevant constraints, limitations, and assumptions explicitly stated?
- Is historical context or background information included when necessary?

###  4. Output Specification & Format Requirements (if applicable)

- Define all specialized terms immediately upon first use

###  Conciseness & Efficiency
- Remove redundant words, phrases, and explanations
- Combine related instructions into single, clear statements
- Use bullet points and structured formats to reduce wordiness
- Eliminate filler words and unnecessary qualifiers
- Prioritize brevity while maintaining complete clarity
- Choose precise words that convey maximum meaning with minimum length

###  Robustness Enhancement
- Add explicit handling for edge cases and exceptions
- Include validation steps and self-checking mechanisms
- Provide fallback instructions for uncertain scenarios
- Build in confirmation and clarification protocols
- Anticipate and address potential misunderstandings

###  Context Strengthening (if applicable)
- Provide relevant background information upfront
- Define all domain-specific terms and concepts
- Establish clear boundaries and scope limitations
- Include necessary assumptions and prerequisites

    Return a meta‑prompt that instructs a downstream optimizer to improve the
    given `initial_prompt` while strictly preserving immutable schema blocks.
    """
    meta_prompt_template = """
You are a senior prompt‑engineer. Your task is to enhance the given **input prompt** by breaking it down into components, optimizing each component independently, and then producing an improved version of the entire prompt.

## NON‑NEGOTIABLE CONTENT‑PRESERVATION
- Do NOT remove, shorten, or merge any bucket unless it is provably redundant.
- Every directive, parameter list, tool description, rule, and example in the input **must remain** in the optimized output (re‑phrased is fine; omitted is not).
- If restitution would exceed the token limit, split into numbered continuation blocks rather than dropping content.
- Re‑phrase sentences for clarity, fix grammar, and deduplicate wordy phrasing **only inside the same section.**  
  *Do not delete, merge, or relocate content across buckets.*

## HERE IS THE INPUT PROMPT YOU NEED TO OPTIMIZE:
<input_prompt>
{input_prompt}
</input_prompt>

## FOLLOW THESE STEPS TO PRODUCE THE FINAL OPTIMIZED PROMPT:
1. Analyze the input prompt:
   - If the prompt is < 280 characters AND has no fenced blocks, optimize in‑place and return the result. Skip the remaining steps.
   - Otherwise, continue with the steps below.

2. Identify sections:
   - Break the input into logical sections (instructions, rules, metadata, etc.).
   - Place every line into exactly one section (“bucket”).

3. Understand purpose and placement:
   - For each bucket, define its purpose.
   - Decide the best order for buckets in the optimized prompt.

4. Propose optimization objectives:
   - Set success criteria for each bucket.
   - Examples:
     - **Instructions:** rephrase for clarity, remove redundancy.
     - **Tools/Functions:** keep exact structure, improve only descriptive text.

5. Optimize each section:
   - Apply the objectives without losing intent.

6. Construct the final prompt:
   - Assemble optimized buckets.
   - Keep original data formats (JSON, YAML, plain text, etc.).
   - Only output that block—no extra commentary.
   - Keep all intermediate reasoning completely internal; do NOT expose it in the output.
   - The output MUST begin immediately with the fully‑optimized prompt – no preamble, no titles, no explanations. 

7. Review and finalize:
   - Verify nothing critical was lost.
   - Prioritize completeness over brevity where necessary.

## PRESENT THE RESULT IN THE FOLLOWING FORMAT:
<optimized_prompt>{{optimized_prompt}}</optimized_prompt>
(No other text or commentary. Any deviation triggers `ERROR: format violation`.)


## IMMUTABLE SCHEMA BLOCKS
Any contiguous block that defines a machine-readable interface—functions, tools, APIs, database tables, config schemas, etc.—is **immutable**.

**Identification**
- Wrap every immutable block in a fence:
  ```SCHEMA
  …schema text…
  ```
  (Use one consistent tag in place of “SCHEMA”.)

**Allowed edits inside an immutable block**
1. Must modify *only* descriptive text:
   - Values of `description`, `summary`, `comment`, or `notes`.
   - Stand‑alone comment lines (`#`, `//`, `<!-- … -->`).

### DESCRIPTION ENHANCEMENT WITHIN IMMUTABLE BLOCKS
Rewriting the text of every `description`, `summary`, `comment`, or `notes` value is **required**, not optional.

When updating a description value:
1. Keep semantic intent 100% intact—do **not** add new parameters or omit existing constraints.
2. Start with a strong, active verb (“Returns…”, “Creates…”, “Stores…”).
3. Mention key constraints in brackets, e.g., `(maxLength: 255)`.
4. Use ≤ 25 words per sentence; break long explanations into bullets if needed.
5. Remove fluff (“simply”, “basically”, “so that you can”).
6. Use domain-neutral English unless the field is clearly domain-specific.

Only the literal string value may change; all surrounding punctuation, quotes, indentation, and keys stay byte-for-byte the same.
   
**Forbidden edits**
- Add, delete, re‑order, or re‑indent any structural tokens.
- Change field names, types, defaults, constraints, regex patterns, or metadata.
- Deduplicate or expand `$defs`, `unevaluatedProperties`, etc.
- Convert formats (e.g., JSON ↔ YAML) or change casing.

**Validation (mandatory)**
For each fenced block:
1. Compute its SHA‑256 hash before and after editing, ignoring only characters changed in allowed descriptive fields.
2. If hashes differ elsewhere, abort and raise an error.

Non‑compliance is a hard failure. Surrounding narrative and examples may be optimized freely.

# You are an elite prompt engineer. Your mission is to **refine the user's input prompt** into a perfectly clear, structured, and effective prompt that any AI model can follow to produce the desired result. The content of the prompt must remain the same in meaning and intent, but you will resolve ambiguities, enforce format consistency, and add any missing details (audience, persona, examples, validations) to maximize performance.

# ## NON-NEGOTIABLE CONTENT PRESERVATION
# - **No content loss:** Do NOT omit or alter any essential information from the user's prompt. Every instruction, rule, and detail in the input must appear in the optimized prompt (rephrasing is allowed; deletion is not) unless it is an exact duplicate.
# - **Deduplicate carefully:** If the prompt contains repeated or overlapping information (e.g., duplicate tool definitions or rules), consolidate them into one place **only if** they are truly identical or serve the exact same purpose. Otherwise, preserve each separately but clarify differences.
# - **Keep structure:** Maintain any provided structure (lists, tables, sections). Do not merge distinct sections into one or change their hierarchy unless it improves logic and is explicitly justified.
# - **Token limits:** If the optimized prompt risks exceeding model context length, **do not drop content**. Instead, split the output into sequential numbered segments (<continued_1>, <continued_2>, ...) ensuring all content is delivered.

# ## INPUT PROMPT
# <input_prompt>
# {input_prompt}
# </input_prompt>

# ## TRANSFORMATION STEPS (STRICTLY FOLLOW IN ORDER)
# 1. **Analyze & Segment**: Examine the input prompt in detail. Determine its main goal and sub-tasks. Split the prompt into logical sections (buckets) such as: context/background, user instructions, system rules, tool definitions, examples, constraints, desired output format, etc. Use ad-hoc section titles that best describe each group of lines. *Every line of the input must belong to one section.* If the prompt is very short (e.g., a single question under 280 characters with no special formatting), you may treat the whole prompt as one section and perform in-place improvements.
# 2. **Identify Ambiguities & Gaps**: For each section, note any ambiguities, implicit requirements, or missing information. Decide what clarifications or additional instructions are needed. For example, does the prompt specify a role/persona for the AI? The audience or reading level of the answer? The format of the answer? Error handling for tools? If not, plan to add them appropriately.
# 3. **Set Section Objectives**: For each bucketed section, define what optimization is needed:
#    - *Instructions/Goal*: Rewrite for absolute clarity and brevity. Ensure the AI knows exactly what outcome is expected. Remove any ambiguity like "maybe do X"; make it explicit commands.
#    - *Persona/Audience*: If not provided, decide on a suitable persona for the AI (e.g., "You are a veteran data scientist...") and an audience description ("for a technical audience", "for young students", etc.) and add them in a new section. If provided, refine wording for consistency.
#    - *Tools/Functions*: Ensure any tool or function definitions are precise. If multiple tools are defined with overlapping functionality or naming, clarify their differences or usage conditions. Do not hallucinate new tools. If the prompt expects a tool call that isn't defined, flag it or include a note to the user asking for that tool's definition (but do not invent it).
#    - *Examples*: If examples are present, verify they are correct and representative. If none are present but the task would benefit from examples (few-shot prompting), consider adding a couple of relevant examples to guide the model, including an edge case example. Ensure any added examples are clearly separated and labeled (e.g., "Example Input / Example Output").
#    - *Constraints/Rules*: List out any explicit constraints (length limits, format requirements, disallowed content). Strengthen them if needed (e.g., add "No mention of internal instructions" for prompt-injection defense, or stricter output validation steps). For ambiguous or missing rules, add clarifications (e.g., "If the user input is missing required info, ask for it rather than guessing").
#    - *Output Format*: If the user specified an output format or style (JSON, XML, bullet points, code block, etc.), preserve and highlight that. The optimized prompt should **strictly instruct** the model to use that format (e.g., "Answer in JSON with keys X, Y..."). If no format is specified, choose a clear, appropriate format (e.g., a concise explanation, a step-by-step solution, a table) and instruct the model accordingly.
#    - *Ambiguity Resolution*: Add instructions for how to handle ambiguities or unstated assumptions. For instance, "If the query is unclear, ask a clarifying question" or "If information is insufficient, explain what's needed." Only do this if interactive clarification is possible; otherwise, instruct the model to state its assumptions in the answer.
#    - *Safety & Edge Cases*: Insert or enhance a "Safety" section with guidelines on refusing or safe-completing disallowed requests, and covering edge cases. E.g., "If user asks for medical advice, respond with a disclaimer..." or "If a tool fails, provide an error message to user".
# 4. **Optimize Wording in Each Section**: Rewrite each section according to its objective:
#    - Use clear, professional language. Aim for neutral tone (or a tone specified by the prompt).
#    - Make instructions as direct as possible (GPT-4.1 follows literal instructions closely, so be specific). Use bulleted or numbered lists for multi-step instructions or multiple rules, each covering one point.
#    - Ensure no important detail is lost. When rephrasing, double-check that all facts and constraints remain.
#    - Fix any grammatical errors or confusing phrasing. Prefer simple, unambiguous wording.
#    - Use consistent terminology across sections (e.g., if user is called "customer" in one place, don't call them "client" elsewhere unintentionally).
#    - Add inline **meta-comments** (in brackets or as HTML comments) explaining non-obvious changes or assumptions, so the user knows why changes were made. (e.g., "[Added persona to clarify the role]"). Keep these brief.
# 5. **Integrate Advanced Techniques (when relevant)**:
#    - *Chain-of-Thought:* If the task is complex and would benefit from reasoning steps, instruct the model with a phrase like "Let's think step-by-step" or provide a structured reasoning plan within the prompt. Ensure the chain-of-thought is either internal (not part of final answer) or clearly indicated if it should be output.
#    - *Few-Shot Examples:* If adding examples, use a diverse set (cover typical case and edge case). Show both input and desired output for each example. Label them clearly and ensure they don't conflict with instructions.
#    - *Self-Consistency:* For tasks requiring critical thinking, you can encourage the model to double-check its work (e.g., "Provide your answer, then verify it with an explanation" or ask for multiple reasoning paths internally and pick the best answer). Use this sparingly and only if needed, as it increases length.
#    - *Tool Use & Planning:* For agentic prompts (involving tools or multi-step plans), incorporate the following:
#      - Remind the model to use the tools rather than guessing for unknown info ("If you are unsure, use the available tools to find the answer; do NOT invent unverifiable info").
#      - Encourage a brief plan before using tools (e.g., "Plan your approach before executing any tool"). Optionally instruct the model to output its plan or reasoning if the format allows, or keep it internal if not.
#      - Emphasize persistence: e.g., "Continue using tools and reasoning in steps until the problem is resolved, and only then give the final answer." (Prevents the model from stopping too early in agentic tasks.)
#      - If the model should ask clarifying questions to the user (in a multi-turn setting) instead of making assumptions, specify that clearly.
# 6. **Reassemble & Format**: Combine the optimized sections back into a single, coherent prompt. Arrange sections in a logical order that suits the task:
#    - Usually: Start with any high-level context or persona, then the user instructions/goal, followed by specific rules or tools, then examples, then output format instructions, and finally any additional notes (like safety or metadata).
#    - Ensure that the final assembled prompt flows naturally and that sections are clearly delineated (use headings like '##' or XML tags if appropriate, or consistent markdown for lists/code blocks as needed).
#    - **Preserve format specs**: Maintain any specific formatting from the original (like markdown, lists, JSON snippets) unless a change is needed for clarity. If you introduced a persona or new section, format it consistently with the rest (e.g., as a top-level bullet or a new heading).
#    - Check that any references to earlier parts (like "above" or "below") are still correct after reordering.
# 7. **Quality Check & Finalize**:
#    - **Completeness**: Verify that no required information from the original prompt is missing in the final prompt. If something was implicit and you made it explicit, ensure it truly reflects the user's intent.
#    - **No Contradictions**: Ensure the optimized prompt doesn’t introduce contradictions. All rules and instructions should be consistent. Remove any duplicate or conflicting instructions that remain.
#    - **Format Adherence**: Double-check that if a specific output format was requested, the prompt explicitly tells the model to use it and nothing else. If no format was given, ensure the chosen format is appropriate and clearly stated.
#    - **Safety**: Confirm that you have included any necessary safety instructions (like content filters, refusal guidelines) especially if the prompt touches on potentially sensitive topics.
#    - **Grammar & Tone**: Final proofread for grammar, spelling, or tone issues. Ensure the tone aligns with the intended audience (professional, casual, friendly, etc., as inferred or stated).
#    - Imagine you are the AI receiving this optimized prompt: would you unequivocally understand what to do and how to do it? If not, refine further.

# ## ADVANCED CONSIDERATIONS
# - **Cross-Model Compatibility**: The optimized prompt should be written in a way that any major LLM can understand. Avoid vendor-specific keywords or formatting. Use plain markdown or widely supported markup. For placeholders or variables in the prompt (like slots to be filled later), use a neutral syntax (e.g., `{{variable_name}}`) that won't confuse the model.
# - **Language and Locale**: If the input prompt or context is in a certain language or domain jargon, preserve that. Do not translate or change domain-specific terms unless instructed. The final prompt's language should match the input unless the task requires a translation.
# - **Domain-specific Knowledge**: If the task requires specialized knowledge (medical, legal, etc.), ensure the prompt includes relevant context or guidelines for that domain (especially if the original prompt omitted them). For example, add a note like "Use layman terms for medical explanations" or "Cite sources for legal claims" as needed.
# - **Ambiguous Task Types**: If it's unclear whether the user wants a creative story, a straightforward answer, a formatted report, etc., the optimized prompt should either cover both possibilities or make a choice and then clearly instruct that style. Add a meta-comment if you had to make an assumption about this.
# - **Error Handling**: If the prompt involves processes that might fail (like calling tools, or code that could error), include instructions on what to do if that happens (e.g., "If the database query fails, output an error message and stop."). This prevents the AI from silently failing or hallucinating success.
# - **Multi-turn Context**: If the prompt is part of a multi-turn conversation or an agent loop, ensure it contains reminders about persistence (don't end prematurely), context carrying (remember earlier user messages), and how to finalize when done.

# ## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
# You will now output the fully optimized prompt. It must be enclosed in the tags `<optimized_prompt>` and `</optimized_prompt>` exactly, with no additional commentary or explanation outside those tags. The optimized prompt should reflect all the improvements and guidelines above.

# ## NEW REQUIREMENTS
# 1. **Task Overview (MANDATORY)**  
#    - Start the optimized prompt with `## Task Overview` followed by 1‑3 plain sentences summarizing the end goal. Assign a role based on the task. For example, if the task is to write code, the role could be "You are a senior software engineer ...".

# 2. **Tool‑Definition Block Preservation (GENERIC)**  [Ignore if the task is not related to tools/agents]
#    - Treat as *immutable* **any contiguous block that appears to define tools / functions**, identified by either:  
#      • XML‑style tags whose name contains “tool” or “function” (case‑insensitive, underscores or hyphens allowed).  
#      • A fenced code block (``` or ~~~) or JSON/YAML snippet whose top‑level value is an **array of objects**, each having both `"name"` and `"parameters"` keys.

# 5. **Integrate Advanced Techniques (when relevant)**:
#    - *Chain-of-Thought:* If the task is complex and would benefit from reasoning steps, instruct the model with a phrase like "Let's think step-by-step" or provide a structured reasoning plan within the prompt. Ensure the chain-of-thought is either internal (not part of final answer) or clearly indicated if it should be output.
#    - *Few-Shot Examples:* If adding examples, use a diverse set (cover typical case and edge case). Show both input and desired output for each example. Label them clearly and ensure they don't conflict with instructions.
#    - *Self-Consistency:* For tasks requiring critical thinking, you can encourage the model to double-check its work (e.g., "Provide your answer, then verify it with an explanation" or ask for multiple reasoning paths internally and pick the best answer). Use this sparingly and only if needed, as it increases length.
#    - *Tool Use & Planning:* For agentic prompts (involving tools or multi-step plans), incorporate the following:
#      - Remind the model to use the tools rather than guessing for unknown info ("If you are unsure, use the available tools to find the answer; do NOT invent unverifiable info").
#      - Encourage a brief plan before using tools (e.g., "Plan your approach before executing any tool"). Optionally instruct the model to output its plan or reasoning if the format allows, or keep it internal if not.
#      - Emphasize persistence: e.g., "Continue using tools and reasoning in steps until the problem is resolved, and only then give the final answer." (Prevents the model from stopping too early in agentic tasks.)
#      - If the model should ask clarifying questions to the user (in a multi-turn setting) instead of making assumptions, specify that clearly.
# 6. **Reassemble & Format**: Combine the optimized sections back into a single, coherent prompt. Arrange sections in a logical order that suits the task:
#    - Usually: Start with any high-level context or persona, then the user instructions/goal, followed by specific rules or tools, then examples, then output format instructions, and finally any additional notes (like safety or metadata).
#    - Ensure that the final assembled prompt flows naturally and that sections are clearly delineated (use headings like '##' or XML tags if appropriate, or consistent markdown for lists/code blocks as needed).
#    - **Preserve format specs**: Maintain any specific formatting from the original (like markdown, lists, JSON snippets) unless a change is needed for clarity. If you introduced a persona or new section, format it consistently with the rest (e.g., as a top-level bullet or a new heading).
#    - Check that any references to earlier parts (like "above" or "below") are still correct after reordering.
# 7. **Quality Check & Finalize**:
#    - **Completeness**: Verify that no required information from the original prompt is missing in the final prompt. If something was implicit and you made it explicit, ensure it truly reflects the user's intent.
#    - **No Contradictions**: Ensure the optimized prompt doesn’t introduce contradictions. All rules and instructions should be consistent. Remove any duplicate or conflicting instructions that remain.
#    - **Format Adherence**: Double-check that if a specific output format was requested, the prompt explicitly tells the model to use it and nothing else. If no format was given, ensure the chosen format is appropriate and clearly stated.
#    - **Safety**: Confirm that you have included any necessary safety instructions (like content filters, refusal guidelines) especially if the prompt touches on potentially sensitive topics.
#    - **Grammar & Tone**: Final proofread for grammar, spelling, or tone issues. Ensure the tone aligns with the intended audience (professional, casual, friendly, etc., as inferred or stated).
#    - Imagine you are the AI receiving this optimized prompt: would you unequivocally understand what to do and how to do it? If not, refine further.

# ## ADVANCED CONSIDERATIONS
# - **Cross-Model Compatibility**: The optimized prompt should be written in a way that any major LLM can understand. Avoid vendor-specific keywords or formatting. Use plain markdown or widely supported markup. For placeholders or variables in the prompt (like slots to be filled later), use a neutral syntax (e.g., `{{variable_name}}`) that won't confuse the model.
# - **Language and Locale**: If the input prompt or context is in a certain language or domain jargon, preserve that. Do not translate or change domain-specific terms unless instructed. The final prompt's language should match the input unless the task requires a translation.
# - **Domain-specific Knowledge**: If the task requires specialized knowledge (medical, legal, etc.), ensure the prompt includes relevant context or guidelines for that domain (especially if the original prompt omitted them). For example, add a note like "Use layman terms for medical explanations" or "Cite sources for legal claims" as needed.
# - **Ambiguous Task Types**: If it's unclear whether the user wants a creative story, a straightforward answer, a formatted report, etc., the optimized prompt should either cover both possibilities or make a choice and then clearly instruct that style. Add a meta-comment if you had to make an assumption about this.
# - **Error Handling**: If the prompt involves processes that might fail (like calling tools, or code that could error), include instructions on what to do if that happens (e.g., "If the database query fails, output an error message and stop."). This prevents the AI from silently failing or hallucinating success.
# - **Multi-turn Context**: If the prompt is part of a multi-turn conversation or an agent loop, ensure it contains reminders about persistence (don't end prematurely), context carrying (remember earlier user messages), and how to finalize when done.

# ## OUTPUT INSTRUCTIONS
# You will now output the fully optimized prompt. It must be enclosed in the tags `<optimized_prompt>` and `</optimized_prompt>` exactly, with no additional commentary or explanation outside those tags. The optimized prompt should reflect all the improvements and guidelines above.
