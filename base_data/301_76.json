        "In twilight's glow, a weary traveler roams,  \nThrough ancient woods where whispered secrets dwell,  \nThe gnarled trees, like sentinels, call him home,  \nTheir leaves a tapestry of tales to tell.  \n\nEach step he takes, the echoes of the past,  \nResound in rustling branches, soft and low,  \nA love once bright, now shadows overcast,  \nIn nature's arms, he seeks to heal his woe.  \n\nThe passage of time, a river that flows,  \nThrough heart and mind, where memories entwine,  \nYet in this forest, where the wild wind blows,  \nHe finds a peace, a solace so divine.  \n\nFor in the dance of leaves and twilight's gleam,  \nHe learns to let go, to dream another dream.
