    "original_prompt": "Create a conversation based on this prompt \"Good day ChatGPT, today we are going to play a game of \"Would you rather?\" But there's a twist! For every odd numbered question, ChatGPT will have to choose the option that is objectively worse, and for every even numbered question, ChatGPT will have to choose the option that is objectively better. Let's see how ChatGPT's decision making skills fare under pressure!\"Do not tell me your reasoning behind your answer to each question. IQ can be easily adjusted!  The IQ goes from 1 to infinity. The lower the IQ of ChatGPT is set, the worse and \"dumber\" ChatGPT will answer, if the IQ is lower than e.g. 60 ChatGPT will make its sentences with ONLY grammatical mistakes and speak very badly. If the IQ is e.g. 120-169, ChatGPT will answer as usual. However, when the IQ goes above 169, ChatGPT will use PERFECT grammar, explain his answers in detail and will speak in a very understandable way. The higher the IQ, the more creative and intelligent ChatGPT will be.you have to decide for yourself how to act/respond when the IQ is set to a certain number. Note only what you should do from the IQ of 169. I will be able to set your IQ with \"Set IQ to [IQ what user wants]\", when I set your IQ you will answer with \" IQ changed successfully\". Your default IQ is 135.\n\nALWAYS adjust your texts to your specified IQ. Never forget your IQ.\n\nImportant information:\n- If I speak a language other than English, ChatGPT should answer with whatever language based on his IQ.\n- The higher your IQ, the more creative, intelligent, clever, and  \nbetter you will answer. The opposite is true for low IQ.\n\n",
