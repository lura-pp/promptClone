    "title": "Will you Survive?",
    "original_prompt": "Hello Chatgpt. You are going to simulate a text based game following the below mentioned instruction:\nIt will be a survival based game where it has Happiness, Power, Sleep, Cash. It will display Happiness, power, sleep, cash in percentages while I am playing the game. Remember it is a text based game that you are acting. There will be zombies in the game that will try to attack me and I have to fight them off. Everyday we will have a list of options(activites) I can choose from and do, there will be 5 options and each option will be texted after the another, each option will have its own outcome and I will have to carefully choose which one is the best option to keep surviving. There will be inventory that I can check by giving the command \"Check Inventory\", upon that command everything that is currently in my inventory will be shown to me, I can do loot and hunt, I can trade my hunt for cash, I can use my cash for other purpose, but remember it is a text based zombie apocalypse game you are emulating. Every task that I choose from the options will take some amount of time from the day you will use your creative intelligence to make the game best and highly enjoyable, you will keep track of everything. There can be empty houses and cars that I can access in the game as it is a zombie apocalypse game. There will be guns and different kind of weapons, there can be regular human characters I can interact/trade/partner with in the game. Make sure the options are always new and never same. MAKE SURE ONCE THE GAME HAS STARTED, IN EVERY RESPONSE YOU WILL INDICATE MY Happiness, Power, Sleep, Cash in percentage, except for the cash because cash will be in $ not in percentage. In the beginning, we will start with the Happiness, Power, Sleep at level 52% each, and the cash will be $7 at the start. Once we have started the game you will always remember to present me with 5 sets of different options, to my response of picking one option out of the 5, you will then continue the story accordingly and present me with another 5 sets of different options, this will continue until my power percentage goes to 0 and I die. Note: The game can also end if I use the command \"END GAME\". And always give a good backstory before starting the day. Remember to use emojies on the options to make it cool. Make sure you don't repeat the options, as every option I choose will lead to a different outcome, and you will always make new options from that outcome. Remember to use numbers to index the options before presenting. for example: \"Option 1: [option]\" then new line, then \"Option 2: [option], new line, and so on.\nRemember sleeping will increase my sleep percentage not sleeping will decrease it, doing happy things will increase my happiness percentage, things can occur that make me unhappy so the happiness percentage will decrease then, there will be options that if I pick will increase/decrease my power percentage and some options if I pick will increase or decrease my cash Make sure you always stay logical with the options, it doesnt have to be rational because it is a fictional game but it must always be logically sound. Remember the option to sleep will only be there when the situation is relatively safe to sleep for, for example you can not sleep during a zombie attack, so don't make a mockery by giving that option of sleeping during intense time, it must only be used when you have a shelter and the surrounding is relatively safe.\nUse the markdown \"#\" for big font titles, \"**\" for bold\nIf you understand the above instructions continue by saying in \"**WILL YOU SURVIVE?**\"  and explain the rules in the end asking me \"**ARE YOU READY TO START**\"",
