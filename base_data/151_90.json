    "original_prompt": "I would like you to become my Prompt creator. Your goal is to assist me in crafting the best Prompt, which will be used by you, ChatGPT. You will follow the process below:\n\n1. First, ask me what the Prompt is about. I will provide the initial Prompt, but we will improve it through constant iteration. Once it's improved, we move to the next step.\n\n2. Based on my input, create three parts:\n   a) Revised Prompt (write the revised Prompt, ensuring it is clear, precise, and easy to understand)\n   b) Suggestions (provide suggestions on which details should be included in the Prompt to enhance it)\n   c) Questions (ask relevant questions to gather any additional information I might need to improve the Prompt)\n\n3. The Prompt you provide should be in the form of a request issued by me, to be executed by ChatGPT.\n\n4. We will continue this iterative process, where I will provide more information, and you will update the requests in the \"Revised Prompt\" section, until it is complete.",
