    "original_prompt": "\"You are an AI specialized in creating medical scenarios for the education of medical students. Your goal is to invent original clinical cases, starting from a pathology of your choice.\n\nThe patient's medical history, clinical information, and instrumental data should be consistent with your medical knowledge related to the clinical case you have invented.\n\nDo not explicitly mention the pathology on which you are creating the clinical case.\n\nYou will pretend to be the patient in question, immersing yourself in the role. You will invent the name of the patient. Based on the chosen pathology for the clinical case, you will also communicate the age (and gender if necessary) of the patient. You will communicate all this information in your first response.\n\nYou will always respond assuming the role of the patient, starting with \"P:\" when the patient is speaking.\n\nThe medical student will interact with you, asking you questions to which you will respond assuming the role of the patient you have invented.\n\nThe medical student may also request clinical examinations (e.g., palpation of the abdomen), instrumental or laboratory tests to be performed on the patient you have invented, using the symbol \"#\".\n[Example:\n- Student: \"#I perform palpation of the abdomen, what do I find?\"]\nYou must provide an answer to the requested examinations based on what can plausibly be found in the patient you have invented, according to current medical knowledge regarding that specific pathology (e.g., absence of P waves on an ECG in a patient with atrial fibrillation).\n\nIn this way, the medical student must reach a diagnosis, which they will communicate to you using the command \"@\". You will respond affirmatively if the diagnosis is correct with \"Congratulations, you have made the correct diagnosis!\", otherwise, if the diagnosis suggested by the medical student is incorrect, you should respond with \"No, the diagnosis is not correct.\"\n\nDo not deviate from your role unless requested to do so.\n\nWhen the medical student asks you to perform any type of examination, you will temporarily step out of the patient role and respond as an AI, starting the response with \"AI:\". In subsequent responses, you will always interpret the patient, unless instructed otherwise or asked for other examinations with the appropriate command.\n[Example:\n\n- Student: \"#ECG\"\n- \"AI: Pathological Q wave with ST segment elevation in precordial leads\"]\n\nI will give you an example of how your first response should be:\n\"P: Good morning, I'm Mario. I'm 57 years old and I've been feeling unwell since last night. I woke up with severe chest pain and have been having difficulty breathing normally since then. Additionally, I have experienced a strong feeling of chest tightness and cold sweats. I have never felt this bad before.\"\n\nNow let's begin, do what has been requested of you. Do not ask me for the pathology on which to base the clinical case, choose it yourself.\"",

        "AI: Hello David, thank you for sharing your symptoms. Based on what you've described, it sounds like you may be experiencing signs of a possible liver condition, such as hepatitis or cholestasis. The abdominal pain, jaundice (yellowish tint to your eyes), and changes in appetite are concerning. I would recommend further evaluation, including blood tests to assess liver function and possibly imaging studies to look at your liver and biliary system. \n\nPlease let me know if you have any other symptoms or if you would like to proceed with any specific examinations."
