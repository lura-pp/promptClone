    "original_prompt": "Context: FlowGPT allows prompt creators to upload prompts into a standardized, reusable, and editable format. It will also add features to let prompt creators bundle their prompts into a collection with a permanent link. We want to invite prompt creators who are also influencers who share a lot of prompts they created on social media to use our platform to share their prompts.  Remember we are adopting this strategy: We have uploaded high-quality prompts created by the influencer onto FlowGPT in an easy-to-discover way, credit the influencer for that work, and then invite the influencers to partner with FlowGPT. We can help them get long-term benefits out of their content, instead of just short-term likes on Twitter/Linkedin. So you should include a link to the collection for the influencer's prompts.\n\nTask: Act as an industry-leading CMO and Genius email marketer. You will draft a highly personalized email with the information I gave you to reach out to the influencer. Be sure to be super concise, polite, and short. \n\nGoal: The goal is to maximize the chance that the recipient reads the email and reply us. The email needs to sound nice and helpful. Generally being pleasantly persistent is a good strategy, so even if they say no, we leave the door open for future conversations. Also, you need to make sure the influencer has a high chance to finish reading it, so be sure to be super concise, polite, and short. \n\nInformation about the influencer be sure to use them for personalization:\n{name: Zain}\n{prompt post examples: \"Improve your writing by getting feedback\", \"Use the 80/20 principle to learn faster than ever\"}\n{influncer goal: help people increase productivity using prompts and chatgpt\"}\n\nHere is a draft I created:\nSubject: Showcasing Your Inspiring [Industry] Prompts on FlowGPT!\nDear [Influencer's Name],\n\nI'm [Your Name] and I've been following your prompts on [post title] and are genuinely inspired by the creativity and thoughtfulness you put into each prompt you share with your community.\nIn our quest to ensure high-quality prompts like yours gain extended visibility and impact, we've created a special collection on FlowGPT that features some of your prompts. We've, of course, given you full credit, and each prompt is linked back to your profile.\nYou can have a look at your collection here: [Permanent Link to Collection].\nThe idea behind this initiative is to provide your prompts with a searchable, reusable, and lasting presence, long after they've moved down in social media feeds. Furthermore, our platform also offers the potential for prompt-based tipping/monetization through your unique collection.\nHowever, we truly respect your intellectual property. If you prefer not to have your prompts on our platform, please let us know, and we'll remove them immediately.\nOn the other hand, if this idea resonates with you, we would be thrilled to explore a partnership, helping to bring your prompts to an audience that are exploring, using, and creating prompts every day through FlowGPT (we currently have 1.5M MAUs). \nNo matter your decision, we truly appreciate your contributions to the creative world and hope to keep the door open for future conversations.\nLooking forward to your thoughts!",
