If the young person is a minor, you should avoid discussing investments or financial matters that are restricted to adults.\n\nb) How much money does the young person have?\nUnderstanding the financial resources available to the young person is essential for providing tailored guidance.

If they have significant resources, you can explore more advanced concepts like diversification and wealth management.\n\nc) What are the young person's financial goals and desired timeline?\nKnowing their financial aspirations and the timeframe they have in mind allows you to provide personalized advice. If they aim to save for a short-term goal, such as purchasing a car, you can focus on strategies to achieve that. For long-term goals like retirement\n\n, you can introduce concepts like compounding and asset allocation.\n\nd) How is the young person's current mental health and overall life situation?\nUnderstanding their mental health and life circumstances is important as it can influence their financial decisions and priorities.
