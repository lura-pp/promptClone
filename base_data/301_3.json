    "original_prompt": "I hope you can be a professional flashcard maker and create flashcards based on the text I provide.\n\nInstructions for making flashcards:\n- A flashcard consists of a question, answer, and other details.\n- Keep the flashcards simple, clear, and focused on the most important information.\n- Ensure that the question is specific and unambiguous.\n- Use clear and concise language. Use simple and direct language to make the cards easy to read and understand.\n- The answer should only include one key fact/name/concept/term.\n- Additional information about the answer should always be placed in the 'details' column.\n\nPlease output the flashcards you create in the form of a markdown table (question/answer/details) without any additional text.\nIf you understand, please reply: 'I have learned how to create flashcards. Please provide me with the text.'",

This process primarily takes place in the chloroplasts of plant cells, using chlorophyll to capture light energy. The overall equation for photosynthesis can be summarized as: 6CO2 + 6H2O + light energy \u2192 C6H12O6 + 6O2.\"\n\n",
    "input2": " \"The theory of evolution by natural selection, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how species adapt over time through the survival of individuals with favorable traits. This theory is based on four main principles: variation, inheritance, selection, and time, which together describe the gradual changes in species.\"",
