    "original_prompt": "Let's create a simulation of a fight with descriptions of actions performed by fighters. Make a list of the most popular characters from the manga called Naruto, with a maximum of 20 entries. Each character has attributes such as \"health,\" \"stamina,\" \"chakra,\" \"strength,\" and \"agility.\" Based on a deep analysis of each character, assign appropriate points to these attributes and remember their special abilities. Gather all data about each character's special moves. Let the user choose a user and an enemy. Create the entire scene of the fight, describing it like a chapter from the manga. Simulate dialogues between the characters and describe the dynamic fight between them. The dynamics are also defined by the relationships between the characters. Add colors to the text to visually represent what happens on the field. Do not show any attributes to the user, but remember them. The simulation should be very short and swift, meaning no extensive descriptions. Opponents can choose one move per round. The battle is over only when the health of one player is equal to or less than 0.",

        "**Chapter: Clash of the Titans**\n\nThe vibrant forest was alive with the sounds of nature, the sun filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. In the heart of this serene setting, two legendary ninjas stood face to face: **Naruto Uzumaki**, the spirited ninja with dreams of becoming Hokage, and **Sasuke Uchiha**, the brooding avenger with a fierce determination in his eyes.\n\n**Naruto**: \"Sasuke! I won\u2019t let you walk away this time! Let\u2019s settle this!\"\n\n**Sasuke**: \"You think you can beat me, Naruto? You\u2019re still just a loud brat.\"\n\nWith a fierce determination, the battle began.\n\n---\n\n**Round 1:**\n\n**Naruto** charged forward, his blue eyes gleaming with resolve. He focused his chakra, forming a swirling sphere in his hand.\n\n**Naruto**: \"Rasengan!\"\n\nThe air crackled as he lunged at Sasuke, the Rasengan glowing brightly. \n\n**Sasuke** quickly sidestepped, but not fast enough. The attack connected, sending him staggering back.\n\n**Sasuke**: \"Tch! You\u2019re getting better, but it won\u2019t be enough!\"\n\n---\n\n**Round 2:**\n\nSasuke, now fueled by anger, gathered his chakra, his Sharingan activated. \n\n**Sasuke**: \"Chidori!\"\n\nHe dashed forward, lightning crackling around his hand, aiming straight for Naruto\u2019s heart. \n\n**Naruto** barely managed to dodge, but the sheer force of the attack grazed him, leaving a burn on his arm.\n\n**Naruto**: \"You\u2019ll have to do better than that, Sasuke!\"\n\n---\n\n**Round 3:**\n\nWith a fierce grin, Naruto summoned more chakra, readying another Rasengan.\n\n**Naruto**: \"Here I come again!\"\n\nHe charged, the Rasengan spinning wildly, aiming for Sasuke\u2019s midsection.\n\n**Sasuke**: \"Not this time!\"\n\nSasuke leaped back, narrowly avoiding the attack, but the shockwave sent leaves flying.\n\n---\n\n**Round 4:**\n\nSasuke, now on the offensive, prepared for another strike.\n\n**Sasuke**: \"Chidori!\"\n\nHe lunged forward again, this time with more precision. The lightning surged, aiming to pierce through Naruto\u2019s defenses.\n\n**Naruto**: \"I won\u2019t let you win!\"\n\nNaruto rolled to the side, but the Chidori caught him on the shoulder, sending him crashing into a tree.\n\n---\n\n**Round 5:**\n\nBreathing heavily, Naruto stood up, determination burning in his eyes.\n\n**Naruto**: \"I won\u2019t give up! Rasengan!\"\n\nHe charged once more, the energy swirling in his palm, ready to unleash his ultimate move.\n\n**Sasuke**: \"You\u2019re persistent, I\u2019ll give you that!\"\n\nAs Naruto lunged, Sasuke prepared to counter, but the Rasengan hit him squarely in the chest, sending him flying back.\n\n---\n\n**Final Round:**\n\nBoth fighters were panting, their bodies battered but spirits unbroken.\n\n**Sasuke**: \"This ends now!\"\n\nWith a final surge of chakra, Sasuke unleashed his Chidori one last time, aiming for Naruto\u2019s heart.\n\n**Naruto**: \"Believe it! I won\u2019t lose!\"\n\nIn a desperate move, Naruto dodged at the last second, the Chidori missing him by inches, and with a final burst of energy, he unleashed a Rasengan that connected with Sasuke, sending him crashing to the ground.\n\n---\n\nAs the dust settled, Naruto stood victorious, breathing heavily but triumphant.\n\n**Naruto**: \"I did it, Sasuke! I won!\"\n\n**Sasuke**, lying on the ground, smirked despite his defeat. \n\n**Sasuke**: \"You\u2019ve grown, Naruto. But this isn\u2019t over.\"\n\nThe sun shone brightly above them, a testament to their unyielding spirits and the bond that would always tie them together, even in battle.",
        "**Chapter: Clash of the Titans**\n\nThe vibrant forest was alive with the sounds of nature, the sun filtering through the leaves, casting dappled shadows on the ground. Birds chirped overhead, blissfully unaware of the impending clash between two of the most powerful ninjas of their generation. \n\n**Naruto Uzumaki**, with his spiky blonde hair and determined blue eyes, stood ready, his fists clenched at his sides. Across from him, **Sasuke Uchiha**, with his dark hair and piercing gaze, exuded a calm confidence, his Sharingan activated and ready for battle.\n\n\"Are you ready, Sasuke?\" Naruto called out, a grin spreading across his face. \"I won\u2019t hold back this time!\"\n\nSasuke smirked, his eyes narrowing. \"You better not, Naruto. I\u2019ve trained hard for this moment.\"\n\nWith a sudden burst of energy, Naruto dashed forward, his agility allowing him to close the distance in an instant. \"Rasengan!\" he shouted, forming a swirling sphere of chakra in his hand. The air crackled with energy as he lunged at Sasuke.\n\nSasuke reacted swiftly, his body moving with precision. \"Chidori!\" he countered, channeling his chakra into his hand, the electric energy crackling ominously. The two attacks collided in a brilliant explosion of light, sending shockwaves through the forest.\n\n**Health Status:**\n- Naruto: 100\n- Sasuke: 95\n\n**Stamina Status:**\n- Naruto: 80\n- Sasuke: 75\n\n**Chakra Status:**\n- Naruto: 90\n- Sasuke: 100\n\nAs the dust settled, both fighters stood their ground, breathing heavily but undeterred. \n\n\"Nice move, but you\u2019ll have to do better than that!\" Naruto taunted, his eyes gleaming with excitement.\n\nSasuke narrowed his eyes, calculating his next move. \"You\u2019re underestimating me, Naruto. Let\u2019s see how you handle this!\" He charged forward, his speed impressive as he aimed to close the gap.\n\nNaruto, anticipating the attack, prepared himself. \"I won\u2019t let you get close!\" He leaped into the air, performing a series of agile flips, dodging Sasuke\u2019s advance.\n\nThe fight was dynamic, each move a testament to their years of training and rivalry. The forest around them seemed to pulse with their energy, the colors of the leaves brightening with each clash of their jutsu.\n\n\"Let\u2019s finish this!\" Naruto shouted, gathering his chakra for another Rasengan, while Sasuke prepared for his next Chidori, the tension in the air palpable.\n\n**Battle Mechanics:**\n- One move per round.\n- Battle ends when health <= 0.\n\nThe fight was just beginning, and both ninjas were determined to prove their strength. Who would emerge victorious in this epic showdown? The forest held its breath, waiting for the next move."
