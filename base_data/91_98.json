Chaos ensues as he starts throwing raw chicken parts at diners who don\u2019t take him seriously, leading to a food fight that spirals out of control.\n\n",
    "input2": " A couple is at a therapist\u2019s office, but instead of discussing their relationship, they start arguing about the best way to cook a potato. The argument escalates into a full-blown shouting match, with each person bringing in increasingly ridiculous props like a potato cannon and a deep fryer. The therapist, trying to intervene, accidentally gets hit with a potato, leading to a surreal moment where they all start yelling about the \u201cpotato wars\u201d and how it\u2019s tearing their lives apart.",
