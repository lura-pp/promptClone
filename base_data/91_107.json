        "**Animal Perspective:**  \nAs a Cheetah, I am the fastest land animal, capable of reaching speeds up to 60 miles per hour in short bursts covering distances up to 1,500 feet. My slender body and long legs are built for speed, and I rely on my keen eyesight to spot prey from a distance.\n\n**Fun Fact:**  \nCheetahs can accelerate from 0 to 60 mph in just a few seconds, faster than most sports cars!\n\n**Did You Know?:**  \nUnlike other big cats, I cannot roar. Instead, I communicate through a variety of sounds, including purring, chirping, and hissing.\n\n**Options:** [Ask more] [Change Animal]"
