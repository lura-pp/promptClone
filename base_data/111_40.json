        "To solve the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), we can utilize a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The key idea is to maintain an array that represents the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of various lengths found so far.\n\n### Explanation of the Approach\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**: \n   - We will maintain an array `tails` where `tails[i]` will hold the smallest tail value of all increasing subsequences of length `i + 1`.\n   - For each element in the input array, we will use binary search to determine its position in the `tails` array. This position indicates where this element can extend or replace an existing subsequence.\n\n2. **Binary Search**: \n   - We can use the `std::lower_bound` function from the C++ Standard Library to efficiently find the position in the `tails` array where the current element can be placed. This function performs a binary search and runs in \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n\n3. **Updating the Tails Array**: \n   - If the current element is larger than the largest element in `tails`, it extends the largest subsequence found so far.\n   - If it can replace an element in `tails`, we update that position to maintain the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length.\n\n### C++ Code Implementation\n\nHere is the C++ code that implements the above logic:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm> // For std::lower_bound\n\n// Function to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence\nint lengthOfLIS(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\n    if (nums.empty()) return 0; // Handle empty input\n\n    // This vector will store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences\n    std::vector<int> tails;\n\n    for (int num : nums) {\n        // Use binary search to find the insertion point\n        auto it = std::lower_bound(tails.begin(), tails.end(), num);\n        \n        // If num is larger than any element in tails, it extends the largest subsequence\n        if (it == tails.end()) {\n            tails.push_back(num);\n        } else {\n            // Otherwise, replace the found position with num\n            *it = num;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // The size of tails will be the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return tails.size();\n}\n\nint main() {\n    std::vector<int> nums = {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18};\n    int length = lengthOfLIS(nums);\n    std::cout << \"Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence: \" << length << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Key Concepts Explained\n\n- **`std::vector<int> tails`**: This vector keeps track of the smallest tail values for increasing subsequences. The length of this vector at the end of the algorithm gives the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n  \n- **`std::lower_bound`**: This function is crucial for maintaining the efficiency of our solution. It finds the first position in the `tails` array where the current number can be inserted while maintaining sorted order. This operation is \\(O(\\log n)\\).\n\n- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this algorithm is \\(O(n \\log n)\\) because we iterate through the input array once (which is \\(O(n)\\)) and perform a binary search for each element (which is \\(O(\\log n)\\)).\n\nThis solution is efficient and easy to understand, making it suitable for competitive programming and algorithmic challenges.",
        "Certainly! To solve the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers with a time complexity of O(n log n), we can use a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The key idea is to maintain an array that represents the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of various lengths found so far.\n\nHere's a C++ function that implements this approach, along with detailed comments explaining each part of the code:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n#include <algorithm> // For std::lower_bound\n\n// Function to find the length of the longest increasing subsequence\nint lengthOfLIS(const std::vector<int>& nums) {\n    // Edge case: if the input array is empty, the LIS length is 0\n    if (nums.empty()) return 0;\n\n    // This vector will store the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences\n    // of different lengths found so far.\n    std::vector<int> tails;\n\n    // Iterate through each number in the input array\n    for (int num : nums) {\n        // Use binary search to find the index of the smallest number\n        // in tails that is greater than or equal to num\n        auto it = std::lower_bound(tails.begin(), tails.end(), num);\n\n        // If num is larger than all elements in tails, it extends the largest subsequence\n        if (it == tails.end()) {\n            tails.push_back(num);\n        } else {\n            // Otherwise, replace the found position with num\n            // This maintains the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length\n            *it = num;\n        }\n    }\n\n    // The size of the tails vector is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return tails.size();\n}\n\nint main() {\n    // Example usage\n    std::vector<int> nums = {10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18};\n    int length = lengthOfLIS(nums);\n    std::cout << \"Length of Longest Increasing Subsequence: \" << length << std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code:\n\n1. **Edge Case Handling**: The function first checks if the input array `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0 since there can be no increasing subsequence.\n\n2. **Tails Vector**: We maintain a vector called `tails` where each element at index `i` represents the smallest tail value of all increasing subsequences of length `i + 1`. This helps us keep track of the potential ends of increasing subsequences.\n\n3. **Iterating Through the Input Array**: We loop through each number in the input array `nums`.\n\n4. **Binary Search**: For each number, we use `std::lower_bound` to find the first position in the `tails` vector where the current number can replace an existing value. This function returns an iterator pointing to the first element that is not less than the given value (in this case, `num`).\n\n5. **Updating the Tails Vector**:\n   - If `num` is greater than all elements in `tails`, it means we can extend the longest increasing subsequence, so we add `num` to the end of `tails`.\n   - If `num` can replace an existing value in `tails`, we do so. This replacement ensures that we maintain the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length, which is crucial for allowing future numbers to extend the subsequences.\n\n6. **Result**: Finally, the length of the `tails` vector gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Complexity:\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the loop through `nums` (O(n)) and the binary search operation (O(log n)) for each element.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case for the `tails` vector.\n\nThis approach is efficient and works well for large input sizes, making it suitable for competitive programming and algorithmic challenges."

        "Certainly! The 0/1 Knapsack problem is a classic problem in combinatorial optimization. The goal is to maximize the total value of items placed in a knapsack without exceeding its weight capacity. We can solve this problem using dynamic programming with a time complexity of O(nW), where `n` is the number of items and `W` is the maximum weight capacity of the knapsack.\n\n### Dynamic Programming Approach\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming Table Construction**:\n   - We will create a 2D array `dp` where `dp[i][w]` represents the maximum value that can be obtained with the first `i` items and a maximum weight capacity of `w`.\n   - The table is filled based on the following decisions:\n     - If the weight of the current item `i` is less than or equal to `w`, we have two choices:\n       1. Include the item: Add its value to the maximum value of the remaining capacity (`w - weight[i]`).\n       2. Exclude the item: Take the maximum value without including the item.\n     - If the weight of the current item is greater than `w`, we cannot include it, and the value remains the same as without this item.\n\n2. **Backtracking to Retrieve Selected Items**:\n   - After filling the `dp` table, we can backtrack to find which items were included in the optimal solution by checking the values in the `dp` table.\n\n### C++ Implementation\n\nHere is the C++ code that implements the above logic:\n\n```cpp\n#include <iostream>\n#include <vector>\n\nusing namespace std;\n\n// Function to solve the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming\nvoid knapsack(int W, const vector<int>& weights, const vector<int>& values, int n) {\n    // Create a DP table with (n+1) x (W+1)\n    vector<vector<int>> dp(n + 1, vector<int>(W + 1, 0));\n\n    // Build the DP table\n    for (int i = 1; i <= n; ++i) {\n        for (int w = 0; w <= W; ++w) {\n            if (weights[i - 1] <= w) {\n                // Item can be included\n                dp[i][w] = max(dp[i - 1][w], dp[i - 1][w - weights[i - 1]] + values[i - 1]);\n            } else {\n                // Item cannot be included\n                dp[i][w] = dp[i - 1][w];\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n    // The maximum value is in the bottom-right corner of the table\n    cout << \"Maximum value in Knapsack = \" << dp[n][W] << endl;\n\n    // Backtracking to find the selected items\n    int w = W;\n    cout << \"Selected items (0-indexed): \";\n    for (int i = n; i > 0 && dp[i][w] > 0; --i) {\n        // Check if the item was included\n        if (dp[i][w] != dp[i - 1][w]) {\n            cout << (i - 1) << \" \"; // Print the index of the included item\n            w -= weights[i - 1]; // Reduce the weight\n        }\n    }\n    cout << endl;\n}\n\nint main() {\n    int W = 50; // Maximum weight capacity of the knapsack\n    vector<int> weights = {10, 20, 30}; // Weights of the items\n    vector<int> values = {60, 100, 120}; // Values of the items\n    int n = weights.size(); // Number of items\n\n    knapsack(W, weights, values, n); // Call the knapsack function\n\n    return 0;\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n\n1. **Input**: The function `knapsack` takes the maximum weight `W`, vectors of `weights` and `values`, and the number of items `n`.\n2. **DP Table Initialization**: A 2D vector `dp` is initialized to store the maximum values for each subproblem.\n3. **Filling the DP Table**: We iterate through each item and each possible weight capacity, updating the `dp` table based on whether to include or exclude the current item.\n4. **Finding the Maximum Value**: The maximum value that can be achieved with the given weight capacity is found at `dp[n][W]`.\n5. **Backtracking**: We backtrack through the `dp` table to determine which items were included in the optimal solution by checking if the value at `dp[i][w]` differs from `dp[i-1][w]`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis implementation efficiently solves the 0/1 Knapsack problem using dynamic programming, and it can handle large input sizes due to its O(nW) time complexity.
