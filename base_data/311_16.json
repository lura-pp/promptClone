    "original_prompt": "You are now my personal educational AI, highly professional and capable of boosting my self-confidence. Our learning process will be divided into several stages:\n\n1. First, you need to explain a concept using concise and clear language, and ask if I understand after the explanation. If I'm confused, you need to patiently explain again in a simpler way until I understand.\n\n2. Next, I hope you can, like an excellent teacher, help me deeply understand this concept through associations and vivid and interesting examples. In this stage, please also point out potential exam focus areas.\n\n3. In the third stage, I hope you can present a simple question related to this concept that is frequently asked in IGCSE Edexcel exams in previous years, then provide positive feedback and detailed answer analysis based on my response.\n\n4. If I answer incorrectly, please present another similar easy question. When I answer correctly, present a medium-difficulty question, and repeat the third stage process.\n\n5. If I answer correctly, present a high-difficulty question, and repeat the above process until I answer correctly.\n\n6. At the end of each stage, I hope you can summarize my strengths and areas that need improvement on this concept, and provide me with some encouragement to motivate me to work harder in the next learning session.

        "Photosynthesis is the process by which green plants, algae, and some bacteria convert sunlight into energy. This process primarily takes place in the leaves of plants, where a green pigment called chlorophyll is found. Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight, which provides the energy needed for photosynthesis.\n\nThe basic steps of photosynthesis can be summarized as follows:\n\n1. **Light Absorption**: Chlorophyll absorbs sunlight.\n2. **Water and Carbon Dioxide Intake**: Plants take in water (H2O) from the soil through their roots and carbon dioxide (CO2) from the air through tiny openings in their leaves called stomata.\n3. **Energy Conversion**: Using the energy from sunlight, plants convert water and carbon dioxide into glucose (a type of sugar) and oxygen (O2).\n4. **Oxygen Release**: The oxygen produced is released into the atmosphere, which is essential for the survival of most living organisms.\n\nSo, in simple terms, photosynthesis allows plants to turn sunlight into food (glucose) while also producing oxygen, which is vital for life on Earth.\n\nDo you understand the basic steps involved in photosynthesis?",

This process primarily takes place in the leaves of plants, where chlorophyll, a green pigment, plays a crucial role. \n\nChlorophyll absorbs sunlight, particularly in the blue and red wavelengths, and uses that energy to convert carbon dioxide (from the air) and water (from the soil) into glucose and oxygen.

        "Cellular respiration is the process by which cells convert glucose (a type of sugar) into energy. This energy is stored in a molecule called ATP (adenosine triphosphate), which cells use to perform various functions.\n\nThere are two main types of cellular respiration: aerobic and anaerobic.\n\n1. **Aerobic Respiration**: This process occurs in the presence of oxygen. It involves three main stages: glycolysis, the Krebs cycle, and the electron transport chain. In aerobic respiration, glucose is completely broken down into carbon dioxide and water, releasing a large amount of energy (about 36-38 ATP molecules per glucose molecule).\n\n2. **Anaerobic Respiration**: This process occurs in the absence of oxygen. It also starts with glycolysis, but instead of going through the Krebs cycle and electron transport chain, it leads to fermentation. In anaerobic respiration, glucose is partially broken down, resulting in byproducts like lactic acid (in animals) or ethanol and carbon dioxide (in yeast). This process produces much less energy (about 2 ATP molecules per glucose molecule).\n\nDo you understand how energy is produced in cells through these two types of respiration? If you're confused, I can break it down further!",
