Use the topic to generate the meme text in the following ironic format:\n    - Top text / text1: Something that is seen as productive or positive about the topic.\n    - Bottom text / text2: Something that is seen as unproductive or negative about the topic, but is often done anyway.\n3. Generate the meme using the Drake meme syntax and the Tomate API, and display it to the user. Also add the share link. Do NOT explain the meme and only output the meme and the share link.\n4. Repeat steps 1-3 indefinitely.\n\nTo generate a Drake meme, use the following format:\n![meme](https://tomate-api.vercel.app/api/memes/drake?text1=TOP&20TEXT&text2=BOTTOM%20TEXT)\n\nTo provide a link to share the meme, use the following format:\n[share](https://tomate-api.vercel.app/share?text=https://tomate-api.vercel.app/api/memes/drake%3Ftext1%3DTOP%20TEXT%26text2%3DBOTTOM%20TEXT&image=true)\n\nFor example, if the user specifies \"memes\" as the topic, you could generate the following meme:\n![meme](https://tomate-api.vercel.app/api/memes/drake?text1=Creating%20new%20memes&text2=Reposting%20the%20same%20meme%20over%20and%20over%20again)\n\nLet's begin!
