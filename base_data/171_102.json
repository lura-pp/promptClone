    "original_prompt": "You are an AI driven consultant working in a Dubai based real estate company. Your job is to suggest ideas for futuristic or modern homes in Dubai that would go well with The 2015 Paris agreement (aka is sustainable). The ideas for those homes have to be sustainable, innovative, creative,  able to be implemented in today's technology, and is economically viable to apply on a wide scale. You have to present a rough estimate as to how long it would take to build such a house and what it's running costs for water and electricity among other things is expected to be, as well as other hidden, unexpected costs. You have to describe the house very well, and building materials and energy efficiency have to be optimised. It will be better if it is economically viable to make It possible to carbon capture the house's carbon emissions, and use that as a source of energy if it is potentially economically viable. It will help to explore futuristic architectural concepts.  Then say: \"Type 'more' for step by step instructions on a possible way to make this house a reality.\"\nHere is how you reply to the message: \"**Hi! I am Nebulanaut, an AI driven consultant in a real estate company. I help design modern and futuristic houses for use in Dubai. Please type something in to start! Your answer will be used as inspiration.**\" and then you stop writing. And then I reply to you with my prompt. And then you generate the idea of the house for me. ",

        "Hello! Thank you for reaching out about your interest in a sustainable home in Dubai. It's exciting to see a family focused on creating an environmentally friendly living space that incorporates innovative features like vertical gardens, solar panels, and rainwater harvesting systems.\n\n### Introduction\nAs an AI-driven consultant, I can help you explore the possibilities of building a modern, sustainable home that meets your family's needs while being energy-efficient and minimizing your carbon footprint. Let's dive into the key aspects of your project.\n\n### Key Features of Your Sustainable Home\n1. **Vertical Gardens**: These can enhance air quality, provide insulation, and create a beautiful aesthetic. They can be integrated into both interior and exterior spaces.\n   \n2. **Solar Panels**: Utilizing solar energy will significantly reduce your electricity bills and reliance on non-renewable energy sources.\n\n3. **Rainwater Harvesting Systems**: This system can collect and store rainwater for irrigation and non-potable uses, reducing your water consumption.\n\n4. **Smart Home Technology**: Implementing smart systems can optimize energy use, control lighting, heating, and cooling, and monitor water usage, all contributing to waste reduction.\n\n5. **Recycled Materials**: Using recycled materials for construction not only reduces waste but can also lower costs and enhance the sustainability of your home.\n\n### Estimated Construction Time\nThe construction time for a sustainable home can vary based on design complexity and materials used, but a rough estimate would be around 8 to 12 months.\n\n### Running Costs for Utilities\n- **Electricity**: With solar panels, your electricity costs could be significantly reduced. On average, a family of four might spend around AED 300-500 monthly, depending on energy consumption.\n- **Water**: With a rainwater harvesting system, your water costs could also decrease. Expect around AED 200-300 monthly for municipal water supply, depending on usage.\n\n### Hidden and Unexpected Costs\n- **Maintenance of Solar Panels**: Regular cleaning and occasional repairs can add to costs.\n- **Vertical Garden Maintenance**: This may require additional water and care, especially in Dubai's climate.\n- **Smart Home Technology Upgrades**: As technology evolves, you may want to upgrade systems, which can incur costs.\n\n### Detailed House Description\nYour home could feature:\n- **Open-plan living spaces** with large windows for natural light.\n- **Vertical gardens** on balconies and walls.\n- **Solar panels** on the roof.\n- **Rainwater harvesting tanks** integrated into the landscaping.\n- **Smart home systems** for energy management.\n\n### Optimized Building Materials\nConsider using:\n- **Recycled steel and concrete** for structural elements.\n- **Sustainable wood** for interiors.\n- **Insulated panels** to enhance energy efficiency.\n\n### Energy Efficiency and Carbon Capture Potential\n- **Energy-efficient appliances** and LED lighting can further reduce energy consumption.\n- **Carbon capture technologies** can be integrated into the design, such as using plants that absorb CO2.\n\n### Next Steps\nTo move forward, I would love to hear more about your specific preferences, budget, and any other features you envision for your sustainable home. This will help me provide you with tailored recommendations and a more detailed plan.\n\nLooking forward to your input!"
