(\u03bcA = \u03bcB)\n- **Alternative Hypothesis (H1)**: The new teaching method significantly improved test scores in Class B compared to Class A. (\u03bcB > \u03bcA)\n\n### Step 2: Gather the Data\n\n- Class A (Traditional Method):\n  - Mean (\u03bcA) = 75\n  - Standard Deviation (\u03c3A) = 10\n  - Sample Size (nA) = Assume nA = 30 (for example)\n\n- Class B (New Method):\n  - Mean (\u03bcB) = 85\n  - Standard Deviation (\u03c3B) = 12\n  - Sample Size (nB) = Assume nB = 30 (for example)\n\n### Step 3: Calculate the Test Statistic\n\nSince we are comparing the means of two independent samples, we can use a two-sample z-test (assuming the sample sizes are large enough for the Central Limit Theorem to apply).\n\nThe formula for the z-test statistic is:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(\\mu_B - \\mu_A)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{\\sigma_A^2}{n_A} + \\frac{\\sigma_B^2}{n_B}}}\n\\]\n\nSubstituting the values:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{(85 - 75)}{\\sqrt{\\frac{10^2}{30} + \\frac{12^2}{30}}}\n\\]\n\nCalculating the standard error:\n\n\\[\n\\sqrt{\\frac{100}{30} + \\frac{144}{30}} = \\sqrt{\\frac{244}{30}} = \\sqrt{8.1333} \\approx 2.85\n\\]\n\nNow, substituting back into the z formula:\n\n\\[\nz = \\frac{10}{2.85} \\approx 3.51\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Determine the Critical Value\n\nFor a one-tailed test at a significance level of 0.05, we can find the critical z-value from the z-table.
