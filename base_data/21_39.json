    "input1": " Did you know that bananas are technically berries, but strawberries aren't? This classification is due to botanical definitions, which can be quite surprising. Additionally, many fruits, like apples and pears, can harbor a toxic compound called amygdalin in their seeds, which can release cyanide when metabolized. Lastly, some fruits, such as the ackee, can be deadly if consumed unripe, as they contain toxins that can cause severe illness or even death.\n\n",
    "input2": " While fruits are often seen as healthy, some can be surprisingly dangerous. For instance, the cashew fruit contains a toxic resin called urushiol, which can cause severe skin reactions. Moreover, the fruit of the elderberry plant is toxic when raw, requiring proper cooking to neutralize its harmful effects. Lastly, the durian, known for its strong odor, can cause respiratory issues in some individuals, making it a fruit that\u2019s both loved and feared in various cultures.",

        "1. While avocados are often praised for their health benefits, they contain a compound called persin, which can be toxic to some animals, particularly dogs and cats. In large amounts, it can lead to serious health issues.\n\n2. The fruit of the cashew tree is edible, but the shell contains urushiol, the same toxic substance found in poison ivy. Consuming improperly processed cashew nuts can lead to severe allergic reactions.\n\n3. The durian, known for its strong odor, can cause respiratory distress in some individuals. Its smell is so potent that it's banned in many hotels and public transport systems in Southeast Asia.",
        "Here are three disturbing facts about fruits:\n\n1. **Bananas and Berries**: Surprisingly, bananas are classified as berries, while strawberries are not. This botanical classification can be quite confusing, as it defies common perceptions of what constitutes a berry. The structure of the fruit determines its classification, leading to this unexpected conclusion.\n\n2. **Toxic Seeds**: Many fruits, including apples and pears, contain seeds that harbor a toxic compound called amygdalin. When these seeds are chewed or digested, amygdalin can release cyanide, a potent poison. While the amount in a few seeds is generally not harmful, consuming large quantities can be dangerous.\n\n3. **Deadly Ackee**: The ackee fruit, native to Jamaica, can be lethal if eaten unripe. It contains toxins that can lead to severe illness or even death. The fruit must be fully ripened and properly prepared to be safe for consumption, highlighting the risks associated with certain fruits."

        "Fruits can harbor unexpected dangers. For example, the seeds of apples contain amygdalin, which can release cyanide when metabolized, posing a risk if consumed in large quantities. Similarly, the unripe ackee fruit is highly toxic and can lead to \"Jamaican vomiting sickness\" if ingested improperly. Lastly, the fruit of the belladonna plant, also known as deadly nightshade, is not only toxic but can cause hallucinations and even death if consumed. Always be cautious with unfamiliar fruits!",
        "Fruits are generally celebrated for their health benefits, but some have disturbing aspects that can pose risks. For example, the cashew fruit contains urushiol, a toxic resin that can lead to severe skin reactions upon contact. Additionally, elderberries are toxic when consumed raw; they must be cooked to eliminate their harmful properties. Lastly, the durian, infamous for its pungent smell, can trigger respiratory issues in sensitive individuals, making it a polarizing fruit that evokes both love and fear across different cultures."
