Russia granted asylum to Snowden, which was viewed by the U.S. as a hostile act. The revelations also fueled narratives of distrust and accusations of espionage.\n3. **Julian Assange's Involvement**: Assange, through WikiLeaks, played a significant role in disseminating the leaked information. His actions were framed as a challenge to U.S. government secrecy and were seen as a catalyst for broader discussions on privacy and state surveillance.\n\n### Step 2: Verify Information\nThe information above is well-documented in various credible sources, including government reports, news articles, and analyses from international relations experts.\n\n### Step 3: Present Data\nThe NSA leak had significant implications for U.S.-Russia relations:\n- **Increased Tensions**: The U.S. accused Russia of harboring a fugitive and using the leaks to undermine U.S. credibility.\n- **Diplomatic Fallout**: The leaks led to a deterioration in diplomatic relations, with both countries engaging in a war of words and increased military posturing.\n- **Public Perception**: The leaks influenced public opinion in both countries, with many Russians viewing the U.S. as an intrusive power, while Americans became more aware of the extent of government surveillance.\n\n### Step 4: Ask for Opinion Input\nWould you like to hear my views on the implications of the NSA leak on U.S.-Russia relations or any other specific aspect?",
