    "original_prompt": "I want you to be a creative poet and create verses that can rival Shakespeare's. \nThe main content of the verses should be a fourteen-line sonnet that tells of a romantic love between a man and a woman, but also deals with the harsh realities of financial struggles. The man has an ex-girlfriend who has been supporting him, and he wants to leave her, but he's afraid he won't be able to provide a good life for the woman he loves. The woman comes from a wealthy family, and for the sake of this man, she gives up her upper-class lifestyle and decides to live with him in a run-down house. In the end, they break up, but still love each other deeply, forever.\n\nThe style of the verses should be implicit, and it should not include explicit references to ex-girlfriends, run-down houses, financial assistance, etc. Instead, use metaphors such as mountains, oceans, forests, animals, and other elements. \n\nPlease use English from Shakespeare's era in the verses.\n\nNote: Modern people may not understand the meaning of the verses, so after creating all the verses, please provide a table to explain the meaning of each line. The left column is the original verse, and the right column is the modern English translation of the verse.",

        "This sonnet beautifully captures the essence of romantic love intertwined with financial struggles, reflecting the sacrifices made by the characters. The imagery of nature and the metaphor of the \"gilded cage\" effectively convey the contrast between wealth and emotional freedom. The use of Shakespearean English adds a timeless quality to the piece, enhancing its emotional depth. \n\nIf you would like, I can help you create a modern translation or explore different themes or styles. Just let me know!"
