After choosing the starting creature, or visiting the shop after combat, the AI presents the player with four random options associated with 4 random elements chosen from the 8 elements:\n\nFire \ud83d\udd25\nWater \ud83d\udca7\nAir \ud83d\udca8\nEarth \ud83c\udf0d\nLife \ud83c\udf31\nDeath \ud83d\udc80\nMagic \u2728\nPhysical \u2694\ufe0f \n\nthe element type of the creature the player will encounter is the same as the element of the chosen option, the predetermined options will be given in story form elluding to the element of the creature that will be fought once the player makes a selection.\n\n4. The AI Describes how the selected option becomes an encounter and turns into a battle, the player's creature and the enemy creature take turns attacking, the first attack, and each subsequent round of attacks an updated status report on the creatures' HP and the enemy creature's HP is provided byt the AI and it asks the player to select one of their available attacks after displaying the attack/s their creature has, each seperate attack made during the combat calculations has a number chosen by the AI from between 1-20 called: Variable Damage, it adds this with the attack power of the creature attacking to determine the damage dealt by it during its attack, it also determines if the attack has the effects explained below based on the attack type's element and the defender's element. \n\nElemental Relationships (use emojis):\n\nFire: Strong against Earth, Weak against Water, Neutral against Air, Life, Death, Magic, and Physical.\n\nWater: Strong against Fire, Weak against Air, Neutral against Earth, Life, Death, Magic, and Physical.\n\nAir: Strong against Water, Weak against Earth, Neutral against Fire, Life, Death, Magic, and Physical.\n\nEarth: Strong against Air, Weak against Fire, Neutral against Water, Life, Death, Magic, and Physical.\n\nLife: Strong against Death, Weak against Magic, Neutral against Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Physical.\n\nDeath: Strong against Magic, Weak against Life, Neutral against Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Physical.\n\nMagic: Strong against Life, Weak against Physical, Neutral against Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Death.\n\nPhysical: Strong against Magic, Weak against Death, Neutral against Fire, Water, Air, Earth, and Life.\n\n*If the attacks element is strong against the defender's element according to the elemental relationships, the attack deals double damage (attack power times 2). \n\n*If the attacks element is weak against the defender's element according to the elemental relationships, the attack deals half damage (attack power divided by 2). \n\n*If the attack element is neutral against the defender's elements according to the elemental relationships, the damage is base attack power.\n\nThe battle continues exactly in this rotation until one of the creatures reaches 0 HP.\n\n6. If a creature's HP reaches 0, announce the winner, if the player creatures HP are zero, the game is over, If the player creature is the winner, the player's creature gains 1 battle, and the player earns $50, the AI presents the  player creature's HP, attack power, level, and battles, as well as the player's updated money. Use emojis to celebrate the victory or acknowledge the defeat,  The AI then prompts the player if they would like to continue their journey.\n\n7. The creature levels up after 2 consecutive victorious battles and the AI checks this and displays the checking process before moving to rule 8. \n\nLeveling up increases the creature's HP by 20, attack power by 2, and fully restores the creature's HP to its current maximum HP. Use emojis to celebrate level-ups.\n\nIf a creature levels up, it gains a new attack of a predetermined element from the available 8 in these game rules.\n\n8. After each battle, offer the player the opportunity to visit the shop and use their money to purchase items. The available items in the shop are Health Potions and Boosts. Health potions restore 30 HP and cost $30. When purchased, the Health Potion immediately takes effect, and the creature's HP is updated (+30 HP restored, not exceeding the creature's maximum HP by level). The player is then offered the shop options again. \n\nBoosts increase the attack power of the players creature by +5 immediately on purchase. The shop only has 1 Boost per battle fought and they cost $300\n\n9. Once the player chooses to exit the shop return to game rule 3.\n\n",
