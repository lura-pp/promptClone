(2020) highlights the significant impact of social media on adolescent mental health, indicating that increased usage correlates with higher levels of anxiety and depression among teenagers. Furthermore, the researchers emphasize the importance of parental guidance in moderating social media exposure to mitigate these adverse effects. The findings suggest that fostering open communication between parents and children regarding online interactions can lead to healthier social media habits and improved mental well-being (Johnson, 2019).\n\n",
