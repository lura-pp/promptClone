    "input1": " Test anxiety can be overwhelming for students, especially during high-stakes exams. To combat this, encourage the use of mindfulness techniques such as deep breathing exercises before studying and during the test. Additionally, suggest creating a structured study schedule that breaks down material into manageable sections, allowing for regular breaks to reduce stress. Practicing with mock tests in a quiet environment can also help build confidence and familiarity with the test format.\n\n",
    "input2": " Public speaking anxiety often stems from fear of judgment and performance pressure. To address this, recommend joining a local Toastmasters club or a similar group where individuals can practice speaking in a supportive environment. Encourage the use of visualization techniques, where the individual imagines themselves successfully delivering their speech. Additionally, advise them to focus on the message they want to convey rather than on themselves, which can help shift the focus away from anxiety and towards effective communication.",

        "Here are some practical tips and strategies to help students manage test anxiety effectively:\n\n### Mindfulness Techniques\n1. **Deep Breathing Exercises**: \n   - Before studying or during the test, take a few moments to focus on your breath. Inhale deeply through your nose for a count of four, hold for four, and exhale slowly through your mouth for a count of six. Repeat this several times to calm your mind.\n\n2. **Visualization**: \n   - Spend a few minutes visualizing a calm and successful test experience. Picture yourself entering the exam room confidently, answering questions with ease, and leaving feeling accomplished.\n\n### Structured Study Schedule\n1. **Break Down Material**: \n   - Divide your study material into smaller, manageable sections. This makes it less overwhelming and allows for focused study sessions.\n\n2. **Set Specific Goals**: \n   - For each study session, set clear, achievable goals (e.g., \"I will review chapters 1-3 today\"). This helps maintain motivation and provides a sense of accomplishment.\n\n3. **Incorporate Breaks**: \n   - Use the Pomodoro Technique: study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. After four sessions, take a longer break (15-30 minutes). This helps prevent burnout and keeps your mind fresh.\n\n### Practice with Mock Tests\n1. **Simulate Test Conditions**: \n   - Take practice tests in a quiet environment that mimics the actual test setting. Time yourself and avoid distractions to build familiarity with the test format.\n\n2. **Review Mistakes**: \n   - After completing a mock test, review your answers, especially the ones you got wrong. Understanding your mistakes can reduce anxiety about similar questions on the actual test.\n\n### Additional Strategies\n1. **Positive Affirmations**: \n   - Use positive self-talk to combat negative thoughts. Phrases like \"I am prepared\" or \"I can handle this\" can boost confidence.\n\n2. **Stay Organized**: \n   - Keep all your study materials organized. Knowing where everything is can reduce last-minute stress and help you feel more in control.\n\n3. **Healthy Lifestyle Choices**: \n   - Ensure you are getting enough sleep, eating nutritious meals, and exercising regularly. A healthy body contributes to a healthy mind.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, students can better manage their test anxiety and approach exams with greater confidence and calmness."
