        "### Test Report: Login Functionality\n\n**Test Objective:** To evaluate the login functionality of the software application under various network conditions and account status scenarios.\n\n**Test Environment:**\n- Application Version: [Specify version]\n- Test Device: [Specify device]\n- Network Conditions: \n  - Normal (baseline)\n  - High Latency (200ms)\n  - Intermittent Connectivity (connectivity drops every 5 seconds)\n\n**Test Cases:**\n\n#### Test Case 1: Normal Network Conditions\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Open the application.\n  2. Enter valid credentials (username and password).\n  3. Click on the \"Login\" button.\n- **Expected Result:** User is successfully logged in and redirected to the dashboard.\n- **Actual Result:** [Pass/Fail]\n- **Notes:** [Any additional notes]\n\n#### Test Case 2: High Latency Network Conditions\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Simulate high latency (200ms).\n  2. Open the application.\n  3. Enter valid credentials.\n  4. Click on the \"Login\" button.\n- **Expected Result:** The application should either log in successfully within a reasonable time or display a timeout message.\n- **Actual Result:** [Pass/Fail]\n- **Notes:** If a timeout occurs, check if the message is user-friendly and informative.\n\n#### Test Case 3: Intermittent Connectivity\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Simulate intermittent connectivity (drops every 5 seconds).\n  2. Open the application.\n  3. Enter valid credentials.\n  4. Click on the \"Login\" button.\n- **Expected Result:** The application should handle the connectivity loss gracefully, either by retrying the connection or displaying an appropriate error message.\n- **Actual Result:** [Pass/Fail]\n- **Notes:** Verify if the error message is clear and instructive.\n\n#### Test Case 4: Locked User Account\n- **Steps:**\n  1. Use a user account that has been locked due to multiple failed login attempts.\n  2. Open the application.\n  3. Enter the locked account credentials.\n  4. Click on the \"Login\" button.\n- **Expected Result:** The application should notify the user that the account is locked and provide instructions on how to unlock it.\n- **Actual Result:** [Pass/Fail]\n- **Notes:** Ensure the notification is clear and provides actionable steps for the user.\n\n### Summary of Findings:\n- **Test Case 1:** [Pass/Fail] - [Details]\n- **Test Case 2:** [Pass/Fail] - [Details]\n- **Test Case 3:** [Pass/Fail] - [Details]\n- **Test Case 4:** [Pass/Fail] - [Details]\n\n### Recommendations for Improvement:\n1. **Timeout Handling:** If timeouts occur, ensure that the message is user-friendly and suggests next steps (e.g., \"Please check your internet connection and try again\").\n2. **Error Messaging:** Improve clarity in error messages for locked accounts, including specific instructions on how to unlock the account (e.g., \"Your account is locked due to multiple failed attempts. Please contact support or reset your password\").\n3. **Performance Optimization:** If high latency significantly affects the login process, consider optimizing backend response times or implementing a loading indicator to inform users that the application is processing their request.\n\n### Conclusion:\nThe login functionality was tested under various network conditions and account statuses. The results indicate areas for improvement, particularly in error messaging and handling of network issues. Further testing is recommended after implementing the suggested changes.",
        "### Test Plan for Login Functionality\n\n#### Objective:\nTo test the login functionality of the software under various network conditions and account statuses to ensure it meets the required standards for performance, usability, and error handling.\n\n#### Test Scenarios:\n\n1. **High Latency Network Conditions**\n   - **Setup**: Simulate a high latency network (e.g., 500ms to 1000ms).\n   - **Test Steps**:\n     1. Attempt to log in with valid credentials.\n     2. Observe the response time and any messages displayed.\n   - **Expected Result**: The application should handle the delay gracefully, providing a loading indicator and a user-friendly message if the login takes longer than expected.\n\n2. **Intermittent Connectivity**\n   - **Setup**: Simulate intermittent connectivity (e.g., disconnecting and reconnecting the network during the login process).\n   - **Test Steps**:\n     1. Attempt to log in with valid credentials while the network is unstable.\n     2. Observe the application's behavior during the connection drops.\n   - **Expected Result**: The application should provide a clear error message indicating the connectivity issue and allow the user to retry the login process.\n\n3. **Timeout Handling**\n   - **Setup**: Set a timeout threshold for the login request (e.g., 30 seconds).\n   - **Test Steps**:\n     1. Attempt to log in with valid credentials while simulating a slow server response.\n     2. Observe the application's response when the timeout occurs.\n   - **Expected Result**: The application should display a user-friendly timeout message and suggest the user try again later.\n\n4. **Locked User Account**\n   - **Setup**: Lock a user account by simulating multiple failed login attempts (e.g., 5 failed attempts).\n   - **Test Steps**:\n     1. Attempt to log in with the locked user account.\n     2. Observe the message displayed to the user.\n   - **Expected Result**: The application should inform the user that the account is locked due to multiple failed login attempts and provide instructions on how to unlock the account (e.g., contact support or wait for a certain period).\n\n#### Reporting:\n- Document any issues or bugs encountered during testing, including:\n  - Steps to reproduce the issue.\n  - Screenshots or logs if applicable.\n  - Severity of the issue (e.g., critical, major, minor).\n- Provide recommendations for improvement based on the findings, such as enhancing error messages or improving the handling of network issues.\n\n#### Conclusion:\nThis test plan aims to ensure that the login functionality is robust and user-friendly under various network conditions and account statuses. All findings will be compiled into a detailed report for review."
