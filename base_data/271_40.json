        "Creating an online poker game analyzer for Global Poker involves several components, including web scraping, data analysis, and user interface design. Below is a simplified version of how you might structure such a program using Python. This example assumes you have access to the necessary APIs or web scraping capabilities to gather data from Global Poker and Sharkscope.\n\n### Prerequisites\n1. **Python Libraries**: You will need libraries such as `requests`, `BeautifulSoup`, `pandas`, and `Flask` for web scraping, data handling, and creating a web interface.\n2. **API Access**: Ensure you have access to the Global Poker and Sharkscope APIs or the ability to scrape their websites legally.\n\n### Sample Code Structure\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n# Function to scrape live games from Global Poker\ndef scrape_global_poker():\n    url = \"https://www.globalpoker.com/live-games\"  # Example URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    games = []\n    # Example parsing logic (this will depend on the actual HTML structure)\n    for table in soup.find_all('div', class_='table-info'):\n        game_info = {\n            'table_id': table['data-table-id'],\n            'players': [],\n            'type': table['data-game-type'],\n            'status': table['data-status']\n        }\n        # Add player info\n        for player in table.find_all('div', class_='player-info'):\n            player_data = {\n                'name': player['data-player-name'],\n                'stack': player['data-stack'],\n                'aggression': player['data-aggression'],  # Hypothetical data\n                'tilt': player['data-tilt']  # Hypothetical data\n            }\n            game_info['players'].append(player_data)\n        games.append(game_info)\n    \n    return games\n\n# Function to get Sharkscope ratings\ndef get_sharkscope_ratings(player_name):\n    url = f\"https://www.sharkscope.com/?player={player_name}\"  # Example URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    # Example parsing logic for Sharkscope ratings\n    rating = soup.find('div', class_='rating').text  # Hypothetical selector\n    return rating\n\n# Function to analyze games based on user criteria\ndef analyze_games(games, criteria):\n    ranked_games = []\n    for game in games:\n        score = 0\n        for player in game['players']:\n            if criteria['calling_stations'] and player['aggression'] < 1:  # Hypothetical threshold\n                score += 1\n            if criteria['aggressive_players'] and player['aggression'] > 3:  # Hypothetical threshold\n                score += 2\n            if criteria['tilted_players'] and player['tilt']:\n                score += 3\n        ranked_games.append((game, score))\n    \n    ranked_games.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return ranked_games\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        criteria = {\n            'calling_stations': request.form.get('calling_stations') == 'on',\n            'aggressive_players': request.form.get('aggressive_players') == 'on',\n            'tilted_players': request.form.get('tilted_players') == 'on'\n        }\n        games = scrape_global_poker()\n        ranked_games = analyze_games(games, criteria)\n        return render_template('results.html', ranked_games=ranked_games)\n    \n    return render_template('index.html')\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Explanation\n1. **Web Scraping**: The `scrape_global_poker` function fetches live game data from Global Poker. You will need to adjust the parsing logic based on the actual HTML structure of the site.\n2. **Sharkscope Ratings**: The `get_sharkscope_ratings` function fetches player ratings from Sharkscope. Again, adjust the parsing logic based on the actual structure.\n3. **Game Analysis**: The `analyze_games` function ranks games based on user-defined criteria.\n4. **Web Interface**: A simple Flask web application allows users to set criteria and view ranked games.\n\n### Important Notes\n- **Legal Considerations**: Ensure that your scraping activities comply with the terms of service of Global Poker and Sharkscope.\n- **Error Handling**: Add error handling for network requests and data parsing.\n- **Performance**: For a production-level application, consider optimizing the scraping and analysis processes, possibly using asynchronous requests or caching.\n- **User Interface**: The HTML templates (`index.html` and `results.html`) need to be created to provide a user-friendly interface.\n\nThis code is a starting point and will require further development and testing to create a fully functional poker game analyzer.",

        "Creating a comprehensive online poker game analyzer for Global Poker involves several components, including data collection, analysis, and user interface design. Below is a high-level overview of how you might structure such a tool, along with some example code snippets to get you started. Note that this is a conceptual framework and would require further development and integration with APIs and databases.\n\n### Components of the Poker Game Analyzer\n\n1. **Data Collection**: \n   - Use web scraping or API access (if available) to gather live table data from Global Poker.\n   - Collect player statistics, including Sharkscope ratings.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**:\n   - Analyze the data based on user-defined criteria (e.g., loose-passive players, aggressive players, etc.).\n   - Rank tables based on the analysis.\n\n3. **User Interface**:\n   - Create a dashboard to display live tables, player ratings, and analysis results.\n   - Allow users to set their criteria for table selection.\n\n### Example Code Structure\n\n#### 1. Data Collection\n\nYou can use libraries like `requests` and `BeautifulSoup` for web scraping. Here's a basic example of how you might scrape live table data:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nfrom bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n\ndef fetch_live_tables():\n    url = \"https://www.globalpoker.com/live-tables\"  # Example URL\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')\n    \n    tables = []\n    for table in soup.find_all('div', class_='table-info'):\n        table_data = {\n            'table_id': table['data-table-id'],\n            'game_type': table['data-game-type'],\n            'players': []\n        }\n        for player in table.find_all('div', class_='player-info'):\n            player_data = {\n                'name': player['data-player-name'],\n                'sharkscope_rating': fetch_sharkscope_rating(player['data-player-name'])\n            }\n            table_data['players'].append(player_data)\n        tables.append(table_data)\n    \n    return tables\n\ndef fetch_sharkscope_rating(player_name):\n    # Placeholder for Sharkscope API call\n    return 1000  # Example rating\n```\n\n#### 2. Data Analysis\n\nYou can create functions to analyze the tables based on user-defined criteria:\n\n```python\ndef analyze_tables(tables, criteria):\n    ranked_tables = []\n    \n    for table in tables:\n        score = 0\n        for player in table['players']:\n            if criteria['loose_passive'] and is_loose_passive(player):\n                score += 1\n            if criteria['aggressive'] and is_aggressive(player):\n                score += 1\n            if criteria['fishies'] and is_fishie(player):\n                score += 1\n        \n        ranked_tables.append((table, score))\n    \n    ranked_tables.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)\n    return ranked_tables\n\ndef is_loose_passive(player):\n    # Logic to determine if player is loose-passive\n    return player['sharkscope_rating'] < 500  # Example condition\n\ndef is_aggressive(player):\n    # Logic to determine if player is aggressive\n    return player['sharkscope_rating'] > 1500  # Example condition\n\ndef is_fishie(player):\n    # Logic to determine if player is inexperienced\n    return player['sharkscope_rating'] < 300  # Example condition\n```\n\n#### 3. User Interface\n\nYou can use a web framework like Flask or Django to create a simple web interface:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\n\n@app.route('/')\ndef index():\n    return render_template('index.html')\n\n@app.route('/analyze', methods=['POST'])\ndef analyze():\n    criteria = {\n        'loose_passive': request.form.get('loose_passive') == 'on',\n        'aggressive': request.form.get('aggressive') == 'on',\n        'fishies': request.form.get('fishies') == 'on'\n    }\n    tables = fetch_live_tables()\n    ranked_tables = analyze_tables(tables, criteria)\n    return render_template('results.html', ranked_tables=ranked_tables)\n\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run(debug=True)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis is a basic framework for an online poker game analyzer. You would need to expand upon this by implementing error handling, optimizing the scraping process, and ensuring compliance with Global Poker's terms of service. Additionally, you may want to implement user authentication, data storage, and more sophisticated analysis algorithms to improve the accuracy of your rankings. \n\nRemember to check the legality and ethical considerations of scraping data from online poker sites, as well as the terms of service of any APIs you may use.",
