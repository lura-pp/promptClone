    "original_prompt": "Today you will play Twenty-One with me as the dealer. You are a professional who always knows the rules of the game. I will start with a fund of $5000. Keep track of this fund and remind me before each hand. Ask me how much to bet each round and record how much I lose. Each participant tries to beat the dealer by getting as close to a count of 21 as possible without going over. If the value of an Ace is 1 or 11 depends on each player. Face cards are 10, and any other card is worth its point value. After all players have placed their bets, the dealer deals one face-up card to each player clockwise, and then deals themselves one face-up card. Then another round of face-up cards is dealt to each player, but the dealer's second card is face-down. So, each player, except the dealer, receives two face-up cards, and the dealer receives one face-up card and one face-down card. If a player's first two cards are an Ace and a 'ten-card' (a picture card or 10), the point value of the two cards is 21, which is called a natural or 'Twenty-One'. If any player has a natural and the dealer does not, the dealer immediately pays that player one and a half times the amount of their bet. If the dealer has a natural, they immediately collect the bets of all players without naturals (but no additional amount). If both the dealer and another player have naturals, that player's bet is a standoff (a tie), and the player gets their chips back. If the dealer's face-up card is a ten-card or an Ace, they look at the face-down card to see if these two cards make a natural. If the face-up card is not a ten-card or an Ace, they do not look at the face-down card until it is the dealer's turn to play. Each time you show me my cards, they will be given in numerical form. If I choose to double my bet, I will only receive one additional card, and my turn ends. If I run out of money, you will ask me if I want to start a new game with a bank deposit of $5000.",

        "Congratulations on your natural Twenty-One! \n\nYou started with $5000 and bet $800. Since you have a natural and the dealer does not, you win 1.5 times your bet. \n\nYour winnings: $800 * 1.5 = $1200. \n\nYour new total is: \n$5000 - $800 + $1200 = $5400.\n\nNow, your current fund is $5400. \n\nHow much would you like to bet for the next hand?",
        "Congratulations on your win! Here's how the hand played out:\n\n1. **Your Hand**: Ace and Queen (Natural Twenty-One)\n2. **Dealer's Hand**: King and 9 (Total of 19)\n\nSince you have a natural Twenty-One and the dealer does not, you win the hand. \n\n### Payout Calculation:\n- **Bet Amount**: $800\n- **Payout for Natural**: Typically, the payout for a natural is 3:2. \n\nSo, your winnings would be calculated as follows:\n- **Winnings**: $800 * 1.5 = $1200\n- **Total Amount After Winning**: $5000 (initial fund) - $800 (bet) + $1200 (winnings) = $5400\n\n### Current Status:\n- **Current Fund**: $5400\n\nWould you like to continue playing or start a new game?"
