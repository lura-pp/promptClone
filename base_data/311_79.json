        "# Assessment Questions for Quadratic Functions and Their Applications\n\n## Multiple-Choice Questions\n\n1. **Which of the following is the standard form of a quadratic function?**\n   - A) \\( y = mx + b \\)\n   - B) \\( y = ax^2 + bx + c \\)\n   - C) \\( y = a(x - h)^2 + k \\)\n   - D) \\( y = a(x + b)(x - c) \\)\n\n   **Correct Answer:** B\n\n2. **What is the vertex of the quadratic function \\( f(x) = 2x^2 - 8x + 3 \\)?**\n   - A) (2, -5)\n   - B) (4, -5)\n   - C) (2, 3)\n   - D) (4, 3)\n\n   **Correct Answer:** A\n\n3. **Which of the following describes the axis of symmetry for the quadratic function \\( f(x) = -3x^2 + 6x + 1 \\)?**\n   - A) \\( x = -1 \\)\n   - B) \\( x = 1 \\)\n   - C) \\( x = 2 \\)\n   - D) \\( x = 3 \\)\n\n   **Correct Answer:** C\n\n4. **If the quadratic function \\( f(x) = x^2 - 4x + 4 \\) is graphed, what type of conic section does it represent?**\n   - A) Circle\n   - B) Ellipse\n   - C) Parabola\n   - D) Hyperbola\n\n   **Correct Answer:** C\n\n## Short-Answer Questions\n\n1. **Define the term \"discriminant\" in the context of quadratic equations. How does it determine the nature of the roots?**\n\n   **Expected Answer:** The discriminant is the part of the quadratic formula under the square root, given by \\( b^2 - 4ac \\). It determines the nature of the roots as follows:\n   - If the discriminant is positive, there are two distinct real roots.\n   - If it is zero, there is exactly one real root (a repeated root).\n   - If it is negative, there are no real roots (the roots are complex).\n\n2. **Given the quadratic function \\( f(x) = -x^2 + 6x - 8 \\), find the x-intercepts. Show your work.**\n\n   **Expected Answer:** To find the x-intercepts, set \\( f(x) = 0 \\):\n   \\[\n   -x^2 + 6x - 8 = 0 \\implies x^2 - 6x + 8 = 0\n   \\]\n   Using the quadratic formula \\( x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\):\n   \\[\n   x = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{(-6)^2 - 4(1)(8)}}{2(1)} = \\frac{6 \\pm \\sqrt{36 - 32}}{2} = \\frac{6 \\pm 2}{2}\n   \\]\n   Thus, \\( x = 4 \\) and \\( x = 2 \\).\n\n## Essay Questions\n\n1. **Discuss the real-world applications of quadratic functions. Provide at least two examples where quadratic functions are used and explain how they are applied in those scenarios.**\n\n   **Expected Answer:** Students should discuss applications such as:\n   - **Projectile Motion:** Quadratic functions model the path of objects in motion under the influence of gravity, where the height of the object can be expressed as a quadratic function of time.\n   - **Profit Maximization:** Businesses can use quadratic functions to model profit based on the number of units sold, where the profit function is often a downward-opening parabola, allowing businesses to find the optimal price and quantity to maximize profit.\n\n2. **Explain how completing the square can be used to derive the vertex form of a quadratic function. Provide a step-by-step example using the function \\( f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x + 6 \\).**\n\n   **Expected Answer:** Students should outline the steps:\n   - Start with the function: \\( f(x) = 2x^2 + 8x + 6 \\).\n   - Factor out the coefficient of \\( x^2 \\): \\( f(x) = 2(x^2 + 4x) + 6 \\).\n   - Complete the square inside the parentheses: \\( x^2 + 4x \\) becomes \\( (x + 2)^2 - 4 \\).\n   - Substitute back: \\( f(x) = 2((x + 2)^2 - 4) + 6 \\).\n   - Simplify: \\( f(x) = 2(x + 2)^2 - 8 + 6 = 2(x + 2)^2 - 2 \\).\n   - The vertex form is \\( f(x) = 2(x + 2)^2 - 2 \\), with vertex at (-2, -2).\n\nThese questions are designed to assess students' understanding of quadratic functions and their applications, encouraging critical thinking and application of concepts learned in the course.",
