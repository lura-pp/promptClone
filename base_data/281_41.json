        "### Feature Description: Enhanced Search Suggestions\n\n**App Name:** Online Marketplace\n\nThe Enhanced Search Suggestions feature is designed to improve the user experience by providing real-time, contextually relevant search suggestions as users type in the search bar. This feature aims to help users find products more efficiently by offering autocomplete suggestions based on popular searches, user history, and trending items. The suggestions will appear in a dropdown menu, allowing users to quickly select a term without needing to type the entire query. This feature not only enhances user engagement but also aims to reduce search abandonment rates and improve overall conversion rates.\n\n### Comprehensive Set of Analytics Events\n\n1. **Search Initiated**\n   - **Event Name:** `search_initiated`\n   - **Description:** Triggered when a user starts typing in the search bar.

This event indicates successful navigation to the results page.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.\n     - `search_query`: The final search term used to generate results.\n     - `results_count`: Number of results returned for the search.\n     - `timestamp`: Time when the results page was viewed.\n\n4. **No Results Found**\n   - **Event Name:** `no_results_found`\n   - **Description:** Triggered when a user searches for a term that yields no results. This event is crucial for identifying gaps in inventory or search algorithm effectiveness.\n   - **Parameters:**\n     - `user_id`: Unique identifier for the user.\n     - `search_query`: The term that returned no results.\n     - `timestamp`: Time when the search was executed.\n\n5. **Search Suggestion Dismissed**\n   - **Event Name:** `suggestion_dismissed`\n   - **Description:** Triggered when a user clicks outside the suggestion dropdown without selecting a suggestion.
