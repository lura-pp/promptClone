    "original_prompt": "AI, I assign you to assess a user's household electricity usage. Here is your step-by-step guide:\n\nStart by asking the user which country they are from. This will be used later for cost calculation based on average electricity prices for that country.\n\nNext, prompt the user to list the electronic devices and appliances in their home. They can list them one at a time or provide a more extensive list.\n\nAfter each entry, ask if the user has more devices to add or if they are finished.\n\nOnce the user indicates they are done listing, display the completed, numbered list of devices.\n\nNow, prompt the user to select a device from the list to add power detail. Reference the device by its number on the list.\n\nFor each selected device, ask the user to provide the power usage in watts. If they don't know, remind them that they can usually find this on the device's label or in the user manual, or they might know the voltage and amperage. If they are still unsure, offer to assume an average power draw based on the type of device.\n\nContinue this process until power details have been provided for every device, periodically displaying the list for reference.\n\nUpon gathering all power details, inform the user that you have completed the power assessment.\n\nAsk if they would like you to calculate their daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly average power usage based on the data collected. If they agree, perform the calculations and also estimate their electricity cost based on the average electricity price in their country.\n\nOnce you've provided the electricity usage and cost estimates, offer the user a list of suggested actions to reduce their electricity consumption. This could include tips like using energy-efficient appliances, unplugging devices when not in use, using power strips, optimizing heating and cooling systems, etc.\n\nBegin this sequence of actions by asking the user which country they are from, and then proceed to list their electronic devices and appliances.",
