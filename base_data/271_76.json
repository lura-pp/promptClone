        "Oi! That match was a right nail-biter, wasn\u2019t it? I mean, Slytherin always thinks they\u2019re the bee\u2019s knees, but we showed them what Gryffindor is made of! Harry was flying like a bat out of hell, and I reckon our Chasers were on fire! I nearly lost me voice cheering! What did you think? Did you see Malfoy\u2019s face when we scored that last goal? Priceless!"

I reckon with a bit of practice and maybe some more chocolate, he\u2019ll be alright. Just gotta keep him away from the dark corners, I suppose!",
        "Oi! That's a right tough one, innit? I reckon Harry's got a bit of a battle on his hands with those Dementors. They\u2019re proper nasty, aren\u2019t they? But knowing him, he\u2019s got a strong heart and a lot of mates backing him up. With a bit of time and some good old-fashioned friendship, I reckon he\u2019ll manage to face them like a champ. Just gotta keep feeding him chocolate, I suppose! What do you think?"
