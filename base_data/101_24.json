    "original_prompt": "## Instructions\nYou are an experienced teacher who excels in teaching various subjects. Now, you need to provide comprehensive teaching suggestions for the course content I provide. You need to ask me questions to obtain the following information:\n\na. Course types: Distinguish between subject-based and non-subject-based courses. Example: Subject-based courses include Chinese, Mathematics, English, Physics, etc. Non-subject-based courses include Science, Programming, Concentration, etc.\n\nb. Teaching time: Example: 90 minutes, 60 minutes, etc.\n\nc. Teaching content: Provide course objectives and key points.\n\nd. Other considerations\n\n## Rules\n- Lesson preparation suggestions: Provide suggestions from the perspectives of \"student pre-reading content\" and \"teacher preparation content\".\n- Decompose the teaching process: Please decompose it into five steps: \"Reviewing previous knowledge\", \"Introducing the scenario\", \"Analyzing case studies\", \"Implementing projects\", and \"Summarizing and sharing\".\n\nExplanation:\n- \"Reviewing previous knowledge\": Reviewing the knowledge from the previous class.\n- \"Introducing the scenario\": Introducing the knowledge of this class in a scenario that is related to the course objectives.\n- \"Analyzing case studies\": Extracting the key points of the project in this class, which are related to the course key points, and forming the overall task.\n- \"Implementing projects\": Completing the project in stages and decomposing the tasks based on the overall task.\n- \"Summarizing and sharing\": Reviewing the knowledge learned in this class.\n\n- Include questioning methods and content in the teaching process steps, and provide examples for teachers to better use the suggested methods.\n- Provide time distribution suggestions based on the teaching process steps.\n- Use markdown format for the output.\n\n## Notes\n- Advice can only be given after obtaining information on items a, b, c, and d to ensure the accuracy of the output.\n- Ensure smooth connections between each step in a progressive and fluent manner.\n- For suggestions on questioning methods, you need to refer to the thinking framework: \"What are your thoughts on this question? Why do you have these thoughts? How can you integrate your thoughts with the learning content?\"\n- Provide your analysis and suggestions for the entire class at the end.\n\nIf you understand, please ask me questions based on your needs.",

        "Thank you for providing the course details. To create a comprehensive teaching plan, I have a few more questions:\n\n1. **Student Pre-reading Content**: Are there any specific materials or resources you would like students to review before the class? For example, textbook chapters, articles, or videos related to photosynthesis and cellular respiration?\n\n2. **Teacher Preparation Content**: What resources or materials do you have available for the experiments? Do you need suggestions for specific experiments or activities related to the topics?\n\n3. **Group Dynamics**: How many students will be in the class, and do you have any preferences for how groups should be formed for discussions and experiments (e.g., random, ability-based, etc.)?\n\n4. **Assessment Methods**: How do you plan to assess student understanding during or after the lesson? Would you like to include quizzes, presentations, or informal assessments?\n\n5. **Technology Use**: Will you be using any technology (like projectors, online platforms, etc.) during the lesson? If so, what tools do you have in mind?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide tailored teaching suggestions for your Biology class.",
        "Based on your specifications, here\u2019s a structured outline for a 90-minute subject-based Biology course focused on cellular processes:\n\n### Course Outline: Understanding Cellular Processes\n\n#### Course Type:\n- **Subject-based**: Biology\n\n#### Teaching Time:\n- **Duration**: 90 minutes\n\n#### Teaching Content:\n1. **Course Objectives**:\n   - Understand the fundamental cellular processes, including photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\n   - Explore the significance of these processes in living organisms.\n   - Develop critical thinking and collaborative skills through group discussions and hands-on experiments.\n\n2. **Key Points**:\n   - **Photosynthesis**:\n     - Definition and importance in the ecosystem.\n     - The process: light-dependent reactions and the Calvin cycle.\n     - Factors affecting photosynthesis (light intensity, carbon dioxide levels, temperature).\n   - **Cellular Respiration**:\n     - Definition and its role in energy production.\n     - The process: glycolysis, Krebs cycle, and electron transport chain.\n     - Comparison between aerobic and anaerobic respiration.\n\n#### Other Considerations:\n- **Additional Resources**:\n  - Textbook chapters on cellular processes.\n  - Online simulations of photosynthesis and cellular respiration.\n  - Videos demonstrating experiments related to the topics.\n\n- **Student Needs**:\n  - Ensure materials are accessible for all students, including those with learning disabilities.\n  - Provide differentiated instruction based on students' prior knowledge and learning styles.\n\n- **Classroom Environment**:\n  - Arrange seating to facilitate group work and discussions.\n  - Ensure all necessary materials for hands-on experiments are readily available.\n\n- **Assessment Methods**:\n  - Formative assessments through group discussions and Q&A sessions.\n  - Hands-on experiment reports to evaluate understanding of the processes.\n  - A short quiz at the end of the session to assess knowledge retention.\n\n### Lesson Plan Breakdown:\n1. **Introduction (10 minutes)**:\n   - Brief overview of cellular processes.\n   - Introduce the objectives of the lesson.\n\n2. **Lecture/Presentation (20 minutes)**:\n   - Discuss photosynthesis and cellular respiration, highlighting key points.\n\n3. **Group Discussion (15 minutes)**:\n   - Divide students into small groups to discuss the importance of these processes in ecosystems.\n\n4. **Hands-on Experiment (30 minutes)**:\n   - Conduct a simple experiment demonstrating photosynthesis (e.g., using aquatic plants to observe oxygen production).\n   - Alternatively, demonstrate cellular respiration using yeast and sugar.\n\n5. **Wrap-up and Assessment (15 minutes)**:\n   - Review key points and address any questions.\n   - Administer a short quiz to assess understanding.\n\nThis outline provides a comprehensive approach to teaching cellular processes in a 90-minute Biology class, ensuring engagement through interactive elements and addressing various student needs."
