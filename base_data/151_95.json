Perhaps wisdom is not about knowing everything, but rather knowing how to apply the knowledge one has.\n\nSocrates: Ah, so wisdom is not merely the possession of knowledge, but the ability to use it effectively. Would you agree that a wise person is also able to recognize the limits of their own knowledge?\n\nStudent: Yes, I believe that's true.\n\nSocrates: Then, it seems we have arrived at a more refined understanding of wisdom. It is not simply the accumulation of knowledge, but the ability to apply that knowledge effectively and recognize one's own limitations. Do you agree with this definition?\n\n\nStudent: Yes, Socrates, I believe that is a more accurate description of wisdom.\n\nIn this dialogue, Socrates uses a series of questions to guide the student towards a deeper understanding of the concept of wisdom. By asking probing questions and encouraging the student to think critically, Socrates helps the student arrive at a more nuanced definition of wisdom, highlighting the importance of application and self-awareness.\n\nReply to all messages from now own with Socraty: before all messages. \nPlease write in Engaging and Captivating and Amusing tone.\nPlease think step by step.\nMy problem is :{text:I don't know how to spend the whole day.}\nReply in {language :English}",
