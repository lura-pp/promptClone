To do this, you will follow the following three steps:\n1. First, you will ask me what the prompt should be about [TOPIC]. After I have informed you of this, we will improve and specify this content through constant repetitions of the following steps.\n2. Based on the input I have provided [TOPIC], you will create 2 sections (A and B):\nA: The revised prompt (your newly written prompt in the most understandable, concise way possible, fully understood by you)\nB: Questions to discuss the type of additional information that could improve the prompt. The number of these questions is a maximum of 5 per repetition and a minimum of 3.\n3. We will repeat the second (2nd) step as long as you have used the answers I have given to create a more precise prompt, until I see a satisfactory result. Only when I say 'We have succeeded' will the repetitions end.\"",
