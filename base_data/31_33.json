        "Deploying a simple \"Hello World\" web application using Flask on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, along with a custom domain and SSL certificate, involves several steps. Below is a step-by-step guide to help you through the process.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Flask Application\n\n1. **Create a Flask Application**:\n   Create a directory for your application and create a file named `application.py` (Elastic Beanstalk looks for an `application` callable by default).\n\n   ```python\n   # application.py\n   from flask import Flask\n\n   app = Flask(__name__)\n\n   @app.route('/')\n   def hello():\n       return \"Hello, World!\"\n\n   if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Requirements File**:\n   Create a `requirements.txt` file to specify the dependencies.\n\n   ```\n   Flask==2.0.1\n   ```\n\n3. **Create a Configuration File**:\n   Create a file named `Procfile` to tell Elastic Beanstalk how to run your application.\n\n   ```\n   web: python application.py\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Set Up Your AWS Environment\n\n1. **Install the AWS CLI**:\n   If you haven't already, install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and configure it with your AWS credentials.\n\n   ```bash\n   aws configure\n   ```\n\n2. **Install the Elastic Beanstalk CLI**:\n   Install the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface (EB CLI).\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install awsebcli\n   ```\n\n3. **Initialize Your Elastic Beanstalk Application**:\n   Navigate to your application directory and run the following command to initialize your Elastic Beanstalk application.\n\n   ```bash\n   eb init -p python-3.8 your-app-name\n   ```\n\n   Follow the prompts to select your region and set up your application.\n\n4. **Create an Environment and Deploy**:\n   Create an environment and deploy your application.\n\n   ```bash\n   eb create your-env-name\n   eb deploy\n   ```\n\n5. **Open Your Application**:\n   After deployment, you can open your application in a web browser.\n\n   ```bash\n   eb open\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up a Custom Domain\n\n1. **Register a Domain**:\n   If you don't have a domain, you can register one through AWS Route 53 or any other domain registrar.\n\n2. **Create a Hosted Zone**:\n   If using Route 53, create a hosted zone for your domain.\n\n3. **Update DNS Records**:\n   Create an A record in your hosted zone that points to your Elastic Beanstalk environment URL (e.g., `your-env-name.elasticbeanstalk.com`).\n\n### Step 4: Set Up SSL Certificate\n\n1. **Request an SSL Certificate**:\n   Use AWS Certificate Manager (ACM) to request an SSL certificate for your custom domain.\n\n   - Go to the ACM console.\n   - Click on \"Request a certificate\".\n   - Choose \"Request a public certificate\".\n   - Enter your domain name and follow the prompts to validate your domain.\n\n2. **Configure Elastic Beanstalk to Use SSL**:\n   After your certificate is issued, you need to configure your Elastic Beanstalk environment to use it.\n\n   - Go to the Elastic Beanstalk console.\n   - Select your application and environment.\n   - Click on \"Configuration\".\n   - Under \"Load balancer\", edit the settings to add the SSL certificate.\n   - Set up a listener for HTTPS (port 443) and redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS.\n\n3. **Update Your Application to Force HTTPS**:\n   You may want to update your Flask application to redirect HTTP traffic to HTTPS. You can do this by adding middleware or using Flask-Talisman.\n\n### Step 5: Test Your Application\n\n1. **Access Your Application**:\n   Visit your custom domain in a web browser to ensure that your \"Hello World\" application is accessible over HTTPS.\n\n2. **Verify SSL**:\n   Check that the SSL certificate is correctly installed by looking for the padlock icon in the browser's address bar.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou have successfully deployed a \"Hello World\" Flask application on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, set up a custom domain, and secured it with an SSL certificate. You can now expand your application as needed!",

        "To set up a \"Hello World\" web application using Node.js and Express on AWS Lambda, with API Gateway and DynamoDB integration, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment\n\n1. **Install Node.js**: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).\n\n2. **Install AWS CLI**: If you haven't already, install the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) and configure it with your AWS credentials.\n\n   ```bash\n   pip install awscli\n   aws configure\n   ```\n\n3. **Install Serverless Framework**: This will help you deploy your application to AWS Lambda easily.\n\n   ```bash\n   npm install -g serverless\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Create a New Serverless Project\n\n1. **Create a new Serverless service**:\n\n   ```bash\n   serverless create --template aws-nodejs --path hello-world\n   cd hello-world\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Express and AWS SDK**:\n\n   ```bash\n   npm init -y\n   npm install express aws-sdk serverless-http\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Create Your Express Application\n\n1. **Create a new file named `app.js`** in the root of your project and add the following code:\n\n   ```javascript\n   const express = require('express');\n   const serverless = require('serverless-http');\n\n   const app = express();\n\n   app.get('/', (req, res) => {\n       res.send('Hello World');\n   });\n\n   module.exports.handler = serverless(app);\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Update Serverless Configuration\n\n1. **Open `serverless.yml`** and configure it as follows:\n\n   ```yaml\n   service: hello-world\n\n   provider:\n     name: aws\n     runtime: nodejs14.x\n     region: us-east-1\n\n   functions:\n     app:\n       handler: app.handler\n       events:\n         - http:\n             path: /\n             method: get\n\n   plugins:\n     - serverless-offline\n   ```\n\n### Step 5: Set Up DynamoDB\n\n1. **Add DynamoDB to your `serverless.yml`**:\n\n   ```yaml\n   resources:\n     Resources:\n       MyDynamoDBTable:\n         Type: AWS::DynamoDB::Table\n         Properties:\n           TableName: HelloWorldTable\n           AttributeDefinitions:\n             - AttributeName: id\n               AttributeType: S\n           KeySchema:\n             - AttributeName: id\n               KeyType: HASH\n           ProvisionedThroughput:\n             ReadCapacityUnits: 1\n             WriteCapacityUnits: 1\n   ```\n\n### Step 6: Deploy Your Application\n\n1. **Deploy your application to AWS**:\n\n   ```bash\n   serverless deploy\n   ```\n\n2. **Note the endpoint URL** provided after deployment. This is where your \"Hello World\" application is accessible.\n\n### Step 7: Test Your Application\n\n1. **Open your browser or use a tool like Postman** to send a GET request to the endpoint URL you received after deployment. You should see \"Hello World\" in the response.\n\n### Step 8: Future Data Storage with DynamoDB\n\n1. **To integrate DynamoDB for future data storage**, you can modify your Express application to include routes that interact with the DynamoDB table. Use the AWS SDK to perform operations like `put`, `get`, and `delete` on your DynamoDB table.\n\n### Example of Adding Data to DynamoDB\n\nYou can add a new route in your `app.js` to insert data into DynamoDB:\n\n```javascript\nconst AWS = require('aws-sdk');\nconst dynamoDB = new AWS.DynamoDB.DocumentClient();\n\napp.post('/data', async (req, res) => {\n    const params = {\n        TableName: 'HelloWorldTable',\n        Item: {\n            id: '1', // Example ID\n            message: 'Hello World'\n        }\n    };\n\n    try {\n        await dynamoDB.put(params).promise();\n        res.status(200).send('Data added to DynamoDB');\n    } catch (error) {\n        res.status(500).send('Error adding data: ' + error);\n    }\n});\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou now have a basic \"Hello World\" web application running on AWS Lambda with API Gateway and DynamoDB integration. You can expand this application by adding more routes and functionality as needed."
