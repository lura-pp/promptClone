However, if discussing a riverbank in a nature document, it should be 'orilla del r\u00edo'. Additionally, consider the idiomatic expression 'to break the bank' which means to spend all one's money, translating it to 'quebrar el banco' in a financial context, but it may not carry the same weight in a casual conversation.\"\n\n",
