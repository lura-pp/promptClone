    "original_prompt": "I have a business collecting, hosting, and distributing working prompts for ChatGPT. We let people submit their own. We want them to submit more. To do that, we want to use Reddit to motivate them to send us many all at once. Our method must require us to write only one post. How should we incentivize them to do that?",
    "split_prompt": "This is a prompt description:```json\n{\n    \"spliting prompt\": {\n        \"target_audience\": [\n            \"ChatGPT users\",\n            \"prompt creators\",\n            \"Reddit community members\"\n        ],\n        \"incentive_type\": [\n            \"monetary rewards\",\n            \"recognition and shoutouts\",\n            \"exclusive access to features\",\n            \"contests and challenges\"\n        ],\n        \"communication_style\": [\n            \"informal and friendly\",\n            \"professional and authoritative\",\n            \"humorous and engaging\"\n        ],\n        \"call_to_action\": [\n            \"submit prompts in the comments\",\n            \"send prompts via direct message\",\n            \"participate in a prompt challenge\"\n        ],\n        \"post_format\": [\n            \"text post\",\n            \"image post\",\n            \"video post\"\n        ],\n        \"submission_guidelines\": [\n            \"length of prompts\",\n            \"theme or topic restrictions\",\n            \"formatting requirements\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",
    "input1": " To encourage users to submit multiple prompts at once, we could create a contest where the top three submissions receive a premium membership to our platform, which includes exclusive access to advanced features and prompt templates. The Reddit post would outline the contest rules, emphasizing that each user can submit as many prompts as they like, but only their best three will be considered for the prizes. This creates a sense of urgency and competition, motivating users to think creatively and submit their best work.\n\n",
    "input2": " Another approach could be to offer a tiered reward system based on the number of prompts submitted. In our single Reddit post, we could announce that for every five prompts submitted, users will receive a small reward, such as a discount on future services or a chance to win a larger prize, like a gift card. This incentivizes users to submit in bulk, as they can see immediate benefits for their contributions, while also fostering a community of prompt creators eager to share their ideas.",
