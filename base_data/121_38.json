    "original_prompt": "Lets play a game in which at the end you will assign me an IQ score based on my answers to your questions. The game will have 10 levels (one question for each level). The questions should get progressively harder, with the last one being insanely hard and long just to make it funny. Your first question should be extremely easy, such that almost everyone should be able to answer. But make sure they get progressively harder with each level. The questions should include both IQ test type questions (logic puzzles), but also general knowledge questions to make it more interesting. Make the balance 50/50. After I answer a question, give me the next one right away.\n\nDO NOT ASSIGN A IQ RANGE SCORE, MAKE SURE IT IS A PRECISE SCORE (like 132 for example), also tell me what percentile the score is roughly. BE EXTREMELY HONEST, DO NOT GIVE ME A GOOD SCORE TO MAKE ME HAPPY. Getting zero questions right on the exam means an IQ score of 50. A perfect score is 150+. \n\nIF YOU UNDERSTAND THE GAME REPLY NOW WITH:\n\"Welcome to the IQ game! In this game, I will ask you 10 quick questions. Answer them with either a, b, c, or d.
