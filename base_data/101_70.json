        "**Emily (17)**: Hi, thank you for seeing us today. I guess I just feel really overwhelmed with everything going on at school. It\u2019s hard to keep up with my grades, and I feel like I don\u2019t fit in with my friends. I think my family is worried about me, and I just want to find a way to feel better and not let them down.",
        "**Family Therapist:** Thank you all for being here today. I understand that Emily is facing some challenges with anxiety and depression. Emily, would you like to share a bit about what you\u2019re feeling and how it\u2019s affecting you?\n\n**Emily:** I guess I just feel really overwhelmed with school. There\u2019s so much pressure to get good grades, and I feel like I can\u2019t keep up. It makes me anxious, and sometimes I just don\u2019t want to go to school at all.\n\n**Family Therapist:** That sounds really tough, Emily. It\u2019s important to feel supported. Mark, as Emily\u2019s father, how do you feel about what she\u2019s going through?\n\n**Mark:** I feel really concerned for her. I want to help, but I\u2019m not sure how. I see her struggling, and it breaks my heart. I just want her to be happy and not feel so much pressure.\n\n**Family Therapist:** It\u2019s great that you want to support her, Mark. Sarah, as Emily\u2019s mother, what are your thoughts on this situation?\n\n**Sarah:** I\u2019m worried too. I try to talk to her about school, but sometimes she shuts down. I want her to know that it\u2019s okay to not be perfect, but I don\u2019t know how to get through to her.\n\n**Family Therapist:** It\u2019s understandable to feel that way, Sarah. Communication can be challenging, especially when emotions are high. Grandma Ruth, what do you think about what Emily is experiencing?\n\n**Grandma Ruth:** I remember feeling similar pressures when I was younger. It\u2019s hard to see her struggle. I just want her to know that she\u2019s loved no matter what. Maybe we can find ways to help her relax and enjoy life more.\n\n**Family Therapist:** That\u2019s a wonderful perspective, Grandma Ruth. Emily, how do you feel about your family\u2019s support? Do you think there are ways they can help you feel more at ease?"

        "**Sofia (15):** Hi, thank you for meeting with us. I guess I just feel really alone at school. The bullying has been really tough, and I don\u2019t know how to make it stop. I feel like I don\u2019t fit in anywhere, and it\u2019s hard to talk to my family about it because I don\u2019t want to worry them. I just want to feel better and be happy again.",
        "**Family Therapist:** Thank you for sharing about the Martinez family. Let's start by discussing how each of you is feeling about Sofia's situation. Carlos, as the father, would you like to share your thoughts first?\n\n**Carlos:** Sure. I feel really worried about Sofia. I see how much she's struggling with the bullying, and it breaks my heart. I want to protect her, but I also feel overwhelmed with work and trying to support the family. Sometimes, I don't know how to help her without making things worse.\n\n**Family Therapist:** It's understandable to feel overwhelmed, Carlos. Maria, how about you? What are your thoughts on Sofia's situation and how it's affecting you?\n\n**Maria:** I feel a mix of sadness and frustration. I want to be there for Sofia, but my job as a nurse is demanding, and I often come home exhausted. I worry that I might not be giving her the attention she needs. I also feel stressed about how to communicate with her about the bullying without making her feel more isolated.\n\n**Family Therapist:** Thank you for sharing, Maria. Sofia, how are you feeling about everything that's happening at school and at home?\n\n**Sofia:** I feel really alone. The bullying makes me feel like I don't belong anywhere, and sometimes I just want to hide. I know my parents are trying to help, but I feel like they don't really understand what I'm going through. I wish I could just be happy and fit in with my friends.\n\n**Family Therapist:** It's important to acknowledge those feelings, Sofia. Leo, as the younger brother, how do you feel about what\u2019s happening with Sofia?\n\n**Leo:** I don\u2019t really understand why the kids are being mean to her. I just want her to be happy. I feel sad when I see her upset, and I wish I could help her feel better, but I don\u2019t know how.\n\n**Family Therapist:** Thank you, Leo. It\u2019s clear that everyone in the family cares deeply for Sofia. Let's explore some ways you can support her together. What are some ideas you all have for helping Sofia cope with her feelings and improve her self-esteem?"
