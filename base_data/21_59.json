The dinner will feature a traditional Thanksgiving menu with options for dietary restrictions, including a turkey, vegetarian stuffing, mashed potatoes, green bean casserole, and pumpkin pie. We will hire a catering service that specializes in holiday meals and arrange seating in a U-shape to encourage conversation. The event will also include a brief welcome speech and a gratitude sharing session to foster a sense of community.\n\n",

The decoration will focus on a rustic theme, featuring burlap table runners, mason jar centerpieces filled with seasonal flowers, and lanterns for ambient lighting. For activities, we will organize a pumpkin carving contest, a Thanksgiving-themed scavenger hunt, and a group storytelling session where attendees can share their favorite Thanksgiving memories. The dinner menu will include a smoked turkey, honey-glazed ham, roasted vegetables, cranberry sauce, and a selection of pies. We will collaborate with a local farm-to-table caterer to ensure fresh ingredients and will set up a long communal table to enhance the communal dining experience.
