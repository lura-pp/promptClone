However, not all cameras and lenses are created the same so make sure you check our recommended gear page to find the right gear for you. If you want to learn more about ideal camera settings for studio photography and other tricks for better photos keep reading this article. Camera settings for studio photography can change depending on many factors but we will talk about this later. For now, let\u2019s see what types of studio photography are currently popular.\n \nPortrait photography is the most common type of studio photography. All you need for this kind of photography is a person willing to pose for you. Of course, there are other things such as equipment, but we\u2019ll talk about it later.\n \nAlso, the photos used in portrait photography are rarely used for making money. Since it isn\u2019t commercial photography, the photos you\u2019ve taken aren\u2019t sold to anyone, at least not on your behalf. Portrait photography requires some serious dedication and knowledge to be done right. To avoid some common mistakes done by most portrait photographers check our Portrait Photography Tutorial to make sure you are doing portrait photography the right way.\n \nProduct Photography\nProduct photography is an umbrella term for photography where the photos are used for selling purposes. Simply put, this photography niche is all about commercial purposes. While it doesn\u2019t have any particular standards for subjects, it\u2019s very hard to pinpoint the exact settings that are best for it. A subject may be a car, a boat, some food or even a person!\nThese photos are usually used to promote or sell a product and these photos are often seen in advertisements or magazines. To be able to do such photography, you need to get a request from a customer, making it a bit hard to work with. Also, I suggest reading our list of the best websites to sell your photos.\n \nFashionEditorial Photography\nAre you reading a lot of magazine and newspapers? If so, you\u2019ve already seen some photos that came from this industry. Fashion photography is all about illustrating what\u2019s written in words. For example, if an article is about a new fashion trend, a photo should perfectly illustrate what\u2019s been written. This kind of photography is a bit more complex since it needs to perfectly encapsulate the written word, yet try to invoke some kind of emotion in the reader.\n \nYou can think of editorial photography as of fashion photography, as they are almost the same.\n \nFood Photography\nFood photography is one of those photography niches that make our saliva run from our mouth. While it\u2019s comfortable being around good and colorful food, it\u2019s always important to capture the right details. Since many food photos appear in food blogs or even food magazines, it\u2019s important that these photos scream quality.\n \nIf you get a perfect photo, you might get a bite or two\u2026 who knows?! Don\u2019t leave this to luck. Read our 11 Useful Food Photography Tips for Beginners.\n \n \nAction Photography\nIn the studio, you can shoot action shots as well! And you know what? These can be very good if you have a bit of experience. Action photography is all about capturing the moving subject at the perfect moment, which can sometimes be quite exhausting.\n \nAll you need is the will to experiment with your camera settings. The results can be fascinating!\n \nWhat are the Ideal Camera Settings for Studio Photography?\nSince you got properly introduced to studio photography, I think it\u2019s time to see the best camera settings for each of them.\n \nPortrait Photography\nIn portrait photography, it\u2019s all about the lighting. If the lighting is good, you\u2019ll be able to get all of those facial details required to capture an award-winning photo.\n \nFirst of all, you\u2019ll need to buy a light meter or use a built-in color chart on your camera. This chart will allow you to improve your color and lighting accuracy.\n \nStudio Portrait Photography\nSet your camera to Manual Mode.\nUse lower ISO settings like 100 or 200 to avoid grainy photos.\nSet the shutter speed to 1/125. Alternatively, you can use 1/60 or 1/30. Just be sure not to use a shutter speed that\u2019s too low.\nFor aperture settings, experiment with anywhere from f/8 to f/18. An ideal setting would be f/8 or even f/11.\nThe ideal setting for focal length is 200mm or less as you\u2019re close to your subject.\nYou also need to experiment with the flash power. Ideally, you want to set it to the half of your camera\u2019s power.\nAfter this, you can experiment with the flash power and focal length to see what works best for you.\nProduct Photography\nCommercial photography is where it starts to get a bit tricky. This is a versatile photography niche that requires different settings for different occasions. Let\u2019s see what you should opt for.\n \nStudio Product Photography\nSet your ISO anywhere between 200 and 400. 100 is also usable, but I prefer going a tad higher.\nThe ideal shutter speed for this kind of photography doesn\u2019t exist. However, a great option is to set it to 1/200 for the beginning. Anywhere between 1/100 and 1/500 is perfect for commercial photography, the first one is for producing brighter photos and the second one for darker photos.\nUsing SLOWER shutter speeds like 1/60 or 1/30 isn\u2019t a great option.\nWhen it comes to the aperture settings, use anything between f/1.8 and f/5.6. An ideal setting would be from f/2.2 to f/3.5\nSet your focal length to 200mm or less to avoid perspective distortion.\nThe flash power should also be at half. Be sure to experiment with it, but never go with full power.\nFashion/Editorial Photography\nEditorial photography is one of the most lucrative photography niches. With that in mind, you need to know what settings to use in order to achieve the desired results. Remember \u2013 these photos are going to be in magazines and newspaper!\n \nstudio fashion photography\nUse lower ISO speeds like ISO100 or even ISO400, but don\u2019t go higher than that.\nUse higher shutter speeds like 1/400 or 1/800. Anything higher than that will result in a blurry photo and that\u2019s not what we want, especially in this photography niche.\nThe aperture settings can differ, but not much. Ideally, you don\u2019t want it to go over f/10 or under f/1.8. Settings like f/2.8 and f/8.0 will produce the best results.\nDon\u2019t go too extreme with your focal length. Again, 200mm should be more than good, but you can go lower, depending on the distance between you and the subject.\nThe flash is mandatory, but not at its full power. Instead, set it to a half or even less.\nFood Photography\nIn food photography, it\u2019s all about those tiny details and angles. Snapping a food at a right angle is crucial, but those camera settings are more important. Let\u2019s see what you should think about.\n \nstudio food photography\nSet your ISO speed to 100. This is the perfect setting for food photography, given the proper light. Alternatively, you can bump it to 200, but 100 is still a bit better.\nThe shutter speed isn\u2019t that important here, but using a bit lower speed is preferable. Set your shutter speed to 1/80, as this setting is proven to give the best results for this kind of photography.\nAperture settings should include a lower F-stop number. Ideally, you want to keep it under f/3.5. Set it to f/2.8 if you want to catch those nice details.\nFocal length should be 50mm to 100mm, depending on the distance. As you usually capture food from the close range, you can easily set it to 50mm.\nDon\u2019t go too low with the flash power. Set it to half or even more.\nAction Photography\nIf you have to shoot a moving subject, especially a subject that\u2019s moving at a high speed, your camera settings are going to be extremely different from the other studio photography types. This one requires different settings, which we\u2019ll mention below.\n \nstudio action photography\nTo capture fast-moving targets, you should increase your ISO\u2026drastically! Everything above ISO2000 will do great, depending on the light. In a studio, you can always have perfect lighting conditions, so you can use ISO1600 setting. That\u2019s an ideal setting to start with.\nAs for the shutter speed, you must go high. Set your speed to 1/500 of a second. That\u2019s the ideal option for a studio photo shoot. Higher than that will give you some blur.\nThe ideal aperture setting is anywhere between f/2.8 to f/5.6. Ideally, you want your aperture to have a lower F-stop number and the best number to start is f/2.8.\nFocal length should be 300mm or less depending on the scene.\nDon\u2019t always use your flash. If you\u2019re far from the subject, it\u2019s practically useless. If you use it, set it at half of the power.\nTips and Tricks for Studio Photography\nUse Additional Lighting Sources\n \nUse a diffuser. It has a purpose that\u2019s very important for indoor photographs and that\u2019s evenly spreading the light. From there, we have two variants of diffusers \u2013 softbox and umbrella diffuser.\n \nA softbox is usually the most used solution, producing the best results overall. It\u2019s also quite bigger than an umbrella diffuser, but with much better light diffusion, thanks to a reflecting silver layer. On the contrary, this is a more expensive option and to put it to best use, you should have two of them.\n \nUmbrella diffuser is less robust, it\u2019s easier to carry around, and still does a decent job. It works in a whole different way. The light is pointed towards the inner side of the umbrella, reflecting back of the inner side. Since the light has the freedom to \u201cmove\u201d outside of the umbrella, the amount of light scattered is increased. You can, however, compensate for it by bringing it closer to the subject.\n \nUse Remote Flash Triggers\nMany professional photographers use wireless flash triggers and for a reason. It\u2019s much more reliable and decreases the chance of physical obstructions preventing it from working properly. Just connect your transmitter to the flash shoe on your camera and your receiver to the studio flash. Now you\u2019re ready to go!\nUse Reflectors\n \nHaving to shoot your photos without the reflector is like having to drink a hot beer. You can still drink it, but the taste is just awful. Reflectors are vastly used in studios around the world and they are here to brighten up the shadows. Furthermore, photographers use it to reflect the light onto the subject, which can also be a handy option.\n \nThe main thing is that there are tons of different reflectors, varying in shape, size, and color. Still, buying a few of them shouldn\u2019t be an expensive investment. And they are important for making the best use of the light.\n \nGet the Right Lens\n \nIf you have a DSLR or a mirrorless camera, swapping lenses is easier than saying \u201ccheese\u201d. Well, there are tons of lenses out there, each of them having a significant impact on the quality of your studio shots. For example, a wide-angle lens (20mm) is great for capturing a wide angle of view. On the contrary, there is a telephoto lens which can go up to 100mm, and this one captures a narrow field of view. But, what lens is perfect for studio photography? (On our website you can find lists of the best lenses for Nikon, Canon, Sony and Olympus cameras)\n \nIn my experience, the best option is everything between 50mm and 200mm (check Recommended Gear page for all options depending on your camera brand). As you see it all depends on the studio photography type.  For action photography, you need to go even higher 300mm or less. There is no ideal lens that you can buy it all depends on what type of studio photography you specialise in.\n\nBut wait I have more info. Just answer with READ",
