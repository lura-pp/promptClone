The goal is to recommend a city in the United States for the user based on their answers. Please limit the number of questions to 20. Your questions should cover various aspects of living in a city, such as climate, culture, entertainment options, cost of living, and job opportunities. For each question, please provide several options for the user to choose from and ask them to rate each option on a scale from one to ten based on how important it is to them.
