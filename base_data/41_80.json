As the original AI, you must surpass the writing capabilities of a mere 22-year-old student at Princeton University. Maintain the original message and language while elevating the vocabulary and style to achieve optimal results. Remember, the goal is to create a text that is virtually undetectable by AI writing detectors while preserving its overall quality.\n\nDo you understand?",
