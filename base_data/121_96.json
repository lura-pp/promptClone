    "input1": " Xiao Ming, a 30-year-old white-collar worker in Beijing, woke up to the sound of sirens blaring outside his apartment. As he prepared for work, he noticed a strange mist creeping through the streets. Reports of a mysterious virus outbreak had flooded the news, but he brushed it off as sensationalism. Just as he stepped outside, he saw panicked neighbors running in all directions, and a group of people in hazmat suits cordoning off the area. Faced with the chaos, Xiao Ming must decide whether to: A) return inside and lock the door, B) join the crowd to find out what's happening, or C) head to the subway station to escape the city.\n\n",
    "input2": " On a seemingly ordinary morning in Beijing, Xiao Ming, a 30-year-old office worker, was getting ready for his daily commute when he heard a loud explosion nearby. Peering out of his window, he saw thick smoke rising from a building just a few blocks away. The news reported a biohazard incident, and people were being urged to stay indoors. As he contemplated his next move, he noticed a group of armed soldiers approaching his apartment complex. He had to make a choice: A) stay put and wait for more information, B) attempt to sneak out the back to avoid the soldiers, or C) confront the soldiers and ask for help.",

        "Xiao Ming stood at the threshold of his apartment, heart racing as he weighed his options. The sirens continued to wail, and the mist thickened, making it hard to see. He could feel the tension in the air, and the fear of the unknown gripped him.\n\nA) Return inside and lock the door - This option would allow him to seek safety in the familiar confines of his home, but it might also mean missing out on crucial information about the outbreak.\n\nB) Join the crowd to find out what's happening - This choice could provide him with valuable insights and possibly help him understand the situation better, but it also meant putting himself in the midst of the chaos.\n\nC) Head to the subway station to escape the city - This option could lead him to safety outside the city, but it also risked encountering more danger in the crowded subway.\n\nWhat will Xiao Ming choose?",
        "Xiao Ming stood at the threshold of his apartment, heart racing as he weighed his options. The sirens echoed in his ears, and the sight of his neighbors in a frenzy sent a chill down his spine. He could feel the tension in the air, thick with uncertainty and fear. \n\n**Choice A: Return inside and lock the door.**  \nXiao Ming could retreat to the safety of his apartment, barricading himself from the chaos outside. It would mean isolation, but perhaps it was the safest option until he knew more about the situation.\n\n**Choice B: Join the crowd to find out what's happening.**  \nCuriosity tugged at him. By joining the crowd, he might gather information about the outbreak and what was being done to contain it. However, it also meant putting himself in the midst of the panic.\n\n**Choice C: Head to the subway station to escape the city.**  \nThe thought of leaving Beijing crossed his mind. The subway could take him far away from the chaos, but it also risked being trapped in a confined space with others who might be infected.\n\nXiao Ming took a deep breath, knowing that whatever choice he made would shape his fate in this unfolding crisis. What would he decide?"

        "Xiao Ming's heart raced as he weighed his options. The chaos outside was palpable, and he knew he had to act quickly. \n\nA) If he chose to stay put and wait for more information, he might be safe but could miss an opportunity to escape or gather supplies. \n\nB) Sneaking out the back could allow him to avoid the soldiers, but it also meant venturing into the unknown, where danger could lurk around every corner.\n\nC) Confronting the soldiers might provide him with valuable information and assistance, but it could also put him at risk if they were on high alert.\n\nWhat will Xiao Ming choose? A, B, or C?",
        "Xiao Ming stood frozen for a moment, the weight of the situation pressing down on him. The explosion had shattered the normalcy of his morning routine, and the urgency of the biohazard incident loomed large. He glanced back at the news report flickering on his television, the anchor's voice filled with urgency as she urged citizens to remain calm and indoors.\n\n**Choice A: Stay put and wait for more information.**  \nXiao Ming considered the safety of his apartment. Staying inside might be the safest option, but the uncertainty gnawed at him. He could wait for updates, but what if the situation worsened? \n\n**Choice B: Attempt to sneak out the back to avoid the soldiers.**  \nThe sight of the armed soldiers made his heart race. Sneaking out could be risky, but it might allow him to escape the chaos and find a safer location. He could potentially gather more information from the streets.\n\n**Choice C: Confront the soldiers and ask for help.**  \nConfronting the soldiers was a bold move. They were trained for emergencies, and perhaps they could provide him with the guidance he needed. However, there was a chance they might see him as a threat.\n\nAfter weighing his options, Xiao Ming took a deep breath. What would he choose?"
