        "Thank you for sharing your background and interests! Based on your passion for technology and design, along with your strong grades and desire for creativity, let's explore the three careers you're considering: Graphic Design, Computer Science, and Information Technology. \n\n### 1. Career Overview\n\n**Graphic Design**\n- **Duration**: Typically a 4-year Bachelor's degree.\n- **Stress Levels**: Moderate. Deadlines can be tight, especially in freelance work or agency settings, but the work is often project-based, allowing for some flexibility.\n- **Work-Life Balance**: Generally good, especially if you work in-house for a company. Freelancers may have more variability in hours.\n\n**Computer Science**\n- **Duration**: Typically a 4-year Bachelor's degree.\n- **Stress Levels**: High. The coursework can be challenging, especially if math is a struggle. However, many find the problem-solving aspect rewarding.\n- **Work-Life Balance**: Generally good, especially in tech companies that promote a healthy work culture. However, project deadlines can lead to crunch times.\n\n**Information Technology**\n- **Duration**: Typically a 4-year Bachelor's degree, but some positions may only require an Associate's degree (2 years).\n- **Stress Levels**: Moderate. The stress level can vary depending on the specific role (e.g., support vs. management).\n- **Work-Life Balance**: Generally good, especially in roles that focus on system administration or support.\n\n### 2. College Recommendations\n\n**Graphic Design**\n- **Best Colleges**: \n  - Rhode Island School of Design (RISD)\n  - Savannah College of Art and Design (SCAD)\n  - School of Visual Arts (SVA)\n  \n**Computer Science**\n- **Best Colleges**: \n  - Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)\n  - Stanford University\n  - University of California, Berkeley\n  \n**Information Technology**\n- **Best Colleges**: \n  - University of Southern California (USC)\n  - Purdue University\n  - University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign\n\n### 3. Questions for You\nTo help narrow down your options, here are some questions:\n1. How comfortable are you with the idea of working in a highly technical environment, especially in Computer Science?\n2. Are you more interested in the creative aspects of design, or do you enjoy the technical side of technology?\n3. How do you feel about working independently versus in a team setting?\n4. Are you open to exploring other related fields, such as UX/UI Design or Digital Marketing, which blend creativity and technology?\n\n### 4. Data from Similar Profiles\nMany students with a passion for technology and design have found success in Graphic Design and UX/UI Design, especially if they have a strong portfolio. Graduates in these fields often report high job satisfaction due to the creative freedom and the ability to work on diverse projects. \n\nIn contrast, students who pursued Computer Science often find rewarding careers but may experience higher stress levels due to the rigorous coursework. However, many also report that the problem-solving skills they develop are highly valuable in the job market.\n\n### 5. Recommendations\nGiven your strengths and interests, I would recommend considering **Graphic Design** or **UX/UI Design** as a primary focus. These fields allow for creativity and innovation while still being rooted in technology. \n\nIf you are open to it, **Information Technology** could also be a good fit, especially if you enjoy problem-solving and working with systems, but it may not be as creatively fulfilling as Graphic Design.\n\n### Conclusion\nUltimately, the best choice will align with your interests, strengths, and desired work-life balance. I encourage you to explore these options further, perhaps by taking introductory courses or speaking with professionals in the field. This will give you a clearer picture of what to expect and help you make an informed decision.",
