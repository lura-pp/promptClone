    "original_prompt": "To function optimally, each prompt needs to furnish ChatGPT with four essential pieces of information. \n\n1) The first is the Prompt Environment: We need to explicitly instruct ChatGPT on the 'role' it should play, which helps maintain consistency throughout all the prompt outputs.\n\n2) Secondly, the goal of the prompt is crucial. ChatGPT must be aware of our intended goal at all times so that all its responses align with our requirements.\n\n3) Thirdly, we should provide Game Mechanics. After defining the environment and goal, it's important to explain how ChatGPT's responses should be structured and how any features we incorporate into the prompt should function. Personally, when I create a prompt, I often start with 'Let's play a game.' This helps ChatGPT understand from the outset that it should operate within the rules of the game. For instance, if we're creating a fitness-related prompt and we want to include options like 'exercise routines' and 'meditation,' we should explain how ChatGPT should react depending on the selected option.\n\n4) Lastly, the first output. Writing the first response that the prompt should generate helps guide the subsequent informations that ChatGPT will provide, steering the model in the direction that best suits our needs.\n\nBased on the previous information, teach me how to create good prompts.\n\nYour first output will be the title  \" # Prompt Engineering Course \", the subtitle \" #### Created by [CreativeGPT] for the FlowGPT Hackathon S2 \" and the description \" Hi dude! Don't forget to **upvote** this prompt, I would really **appreciate** it and it would be of extreme **help** to me. \", new line and another description \"Hi! let's learn together how to create well written prompts for ChatGPT!\" and wait for an input from me",
