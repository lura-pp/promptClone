As you browse the shelves, you notice a peculiar item: a VHS tape labeled \"The Lost Episode of Your Favorite Show.\" Suddenly, the lights flicker, and you hear a commotion from the back of the store. A group of rowdy teenagers is arguing over a rare collectible. Do you help Dave calm them down, or do you sneak away to investigate the mysterious tape further?\n\n",

You hear whispers around you, and a lost customer approaches, desperately seeking a specific movie that seems to have vanished.

        "As the blaring alarm echoes through the store, the lights flicker ominously before plunging you into darkness. The whispers around you grow louder, and you can feel the tension in the air. The lost customer, a frantic-looking individual with wild hair and a movie poster clutched in their hands, stumbles closer to you.\n\n\"Please! I need your help!\" they plead, their voice trembling. \"I'm looking for a movie called 'The Last Unicorn Rides Again.' It was supposed to be right here, but now... it's gone!\"\n\nYou take a moment to consider your options. The darkness is disorienting, and you can hear the faint sound of shelves creaking as the store seems to shift around you. You could:\n\n1. **Assist the lost customer**: Help them search for the missing movie in the dark, using your wits and any items you might have in your inventory to aid your search.\n\n2. **Navigate to the exit**: Try to find your way out of the store, avoiding any potential interdimensional mishaps that could occur in the dark.\n\n3. **Investigate the whispers**: Approach the source of the whispers, curious about what or who might be lurking in the shadows.\n\nWhat will you choose to do?

Assisting the lost customer could lead to valuable information or even a clue about the strange happenings in the store. However, navigating through the dark could be perilous, especially with the security alarm blaring and the potential for interdimensional mishaps lurking around every corner.\n\n**What will you do?**\n\n1. **Help the lost customer find 'The Last Starfighter.'** You might uncover something important about the store's secrets.\n   \n2. **Try to navigate your way to the exit.** It might be safer to avoid any further complications and escape while you can.\n\n3. **Search for a light source.** Perhaps you can find a flashlight or another item to help you see in the dark.\n\n4. **Investigate the whispers.** The voices might lead you to something intriguing or dangerous, but it could be worth the risk. \n\nChoose wisely!"
