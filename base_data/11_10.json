He founded the Pythagorean school, where he and his followers explored the relationships between numbers and shapes, laying the groundwork for future mathematical thought.\n\n",
    "input2": " Pythagorean Theorem - The Pythagorean theorem, attributed to Pythagoras, states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides.

        "Euclid - Euclid, often referred to as the \"Father of Geometry,\" was a Greek mathematician who lived around 300 BCE. His most famous work, \"Elements,\" is a comprehensive compilation of the knowledge of geometry of his time, organized into a logical framework. Euclid's axiomatic approach and systematic method of proving geometric theorems have influenced mathematics for centuries and are still taught in geometry courses today.\n\nArchimedes - Archimedes was a Greek mathematician, physicist, and engineer who lived in the 3rd century BCE. He made significant contributions to geometry, particularly in calculating areas and volumes of shapes, such as spheres and cylinders. Archimedes is also known for his work on the principles of lever and buoyancy, and he is credited with the approximation of pi, which laid the groundwork for future mathematical analysis.\n\nIsaac Newton - Isaac Newton was an English mathematician and physicist in the 17th century who co-developed calculus independently of Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. His work in mathematics included the formulation of the fundamental theorem of calculus, which connects differentiation and integration, and his contributions to mathematical physics, particularly in understanding motion and gravitation.\n\nGottfried Wilhelm Leibniz - Leibniz was a German mathematician and philosopher who, in the late 17th century, independently developed calculus around the same time as Isaac Newton. He introduced the notation for differentiation (dy/dx) and integration (\u222b), which are still in use today. Leibniz's work emphasized the importance of mathematical rigor and the application of calculus to various fields.\n\nCarl Friedrich Gauss - Gauss, known as the \"Prince of Mathematicians,\" made profound contributions to many areas of mathematics in the late 18th and early 19th centuries. His work in number theory, particularly the distribution of prime numbers and the concept of congruences, laid the foundation for modern number theory. Gauss also contributed to statistics, astronomy, and the theory of errors.\n\nGeorg Cantor - Cantor was a German mathematician in the late 19th century who is best known for founding set theory and introducing the concept of different sizes of infinity. His work on cardinal and ordinal numbers revolutionized the understanding of infinity and laid the groundwork for modern mathematics, influencing various fields such as topology and analysis.\n\nDavid Hilbert - Hilbert was a German mathematician in the late 19th and early 20th centuries who made significant contributions to various areas of mathematics, including algebra, number theory, and mathematical logic. He is known for Hilbert's problems, a list of 23 unsolved problems that guided much of 20th-century mathematics and for his work on formalism in mathematics, which sought to establish a solid foundation for all mathematical truths.",

        "Pythagorean Theorem - The Pythagorean theorem, attributed to Pythagoras, states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. This theorem not only has profound implications in geometry but also influenced various fields such as physics, engineering, and architecture throughout history. Pythagoras and his followers, known as the Pythagoreans, also contributed to the development of number theory, particularly in their study of whole numbers and their relationships.",

This theorem establishes a fundamental relationship in Euclidean geometry, specifically in right triangles, where the square of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides. Pythagoras' work laid the groundwork for future mathematical concepts and has had a lasting impact on various disciplines, including mathematics, physics, engineering, and architecture. His contributions extend beyond geometry, influencing the development of number theory and the philosophical understanding of numbers."
