    "input1": " Despite the fact that I have studied English for several years, I still find it difficult to express my thoughts clearly in writing. I often mix up tenses and struggle with vocabulary choices, especially when trying to use more advanced words. For instance, I might say \"I go to the store yesterday\" instead of \"I went to the store yesterday.\" Additionally, I sometimes use words incorrectly, like saying \"I am boring\" instead of \"I am bored.\" \n\n",
    "input2": " When I was younger, I used to think that learning a new language would be easy, but now I realize that it requires a lot of practice and dedication. I often make mistakes in my spoken English, such as saying \"He don't like it\" instead of \"He doesn't like it.\" Furthermore, I have trouble with prepositions, often using them incorrectly in sentences. For example, I might say \"I am good in math\" instead of \"I am good at math.\"",

        "Thank you for sharing your thoughts. Let's evaluate your writing based on grammar, vocabulary, and overall coherence.\n\n### Evaluation:\n\n1. **Grammar:**\n   - Your sentences are generally well-structured, but you have provided examples of common grammatical errors. \n   - The example \"I go to the store yesterday\" is a clear illustration of a tense error. The correct form is \"I went to the store yesterday,\" which you correctly identified.\n   - The phrase \"I am boring\" instead of \"I am bored\" is another good example of a common mistake regarding the use of adjectives.\n\n2. **Vocabulary:**\n   - Your vocabulary is appropriate for the context, and you demonstrate an awareness of the need for more advanced words. However, you did not provide examples of advanced vocabulary usage in your writing.\n   - The use of \"mix up\" is informal; consider using \"confuse\" for a more formal tone.\n\n3. **Coherence and Clarity:**\n   - Your writing is coherent and clearly conveys your struggles with English. You effectively communicate your challenges, which is important for clarity.\n   - However, you could enhance your writing by providing more examples of advanced vocabulary or specific contexts where you struggle.\n\n### Suggestions for Improvement:\n- Practice using different tenses in writing exercises to reinforce your understanding.\n- Expand your vocabulary by reading more advanced texts and noting new words, then try to use them in sentences.\n- Consider writing short paragraphs on various topics to practice expressing your thoughts clearly and coherently.\n\n### Score:\nBased on the CET-6 standards, I would score your writing a **B** (around 75 out of 100). You demonstrate a good understanding of basic grammar and vocabulary but need to work on more complex structures and vocabulary usage. Keep practicing, and you'll see improvement!",
        "Thank you for sharing your writing. Let's break it down according to the tasks outlined.\n\n### Grammar Mistakes:\n1. **Tense Usage**: \n   - \"I go to the store yesterday\" should be \"I went to the store yesterday.\" This is a clear mix-up of present and past tense.\n   \n2. **Incorrect Verb Form**: \n   - \"I am boring\" should be \"I am bored.\" The former implies that you are causing boredom, while the latter indicates that you feel bored.\n\n### Vocabulary Mistakes:\n- Your vocabulary choices are generally appropriate, but the misuse of \"boring\" vs. \"bored\" indicates a misunderstanding of word forms. \n\n### Evaluations:\n- Overall, your writing demonstrates a good understanding of basic sentence structure. However, the errors in tense and word choice suggest that you need to focus on these areas to improve clarity in your writing.\n\n### Suggestions:\n1. **Practice Tenses**: Engage in exercises that focus on verb tenses. Try writing sentences in different tenses to reinforce your understanding.\n2. **Word Forms**: Create a list of commonly confused words (like \"bored\" vs. \"boring\") and practice using them in sentences.\n3. **Writing Practice**: Write short paragraphs on various topics and ask for feedback. This will help you identify recurring mistakes and improve over time.\n\n### Score According to CET-6 Standards:\nBased on the content provided, I would score your writing around **B2** level. You demonstrate a good command of English but need to work on specific grammar and vocabulary issues to reach a higher proficiency level. Focus on the areas mentioned, and you will see improvement in your writing skills."

        "Your writing demonstrates a clear understanding of the topic and effectively communicates your thoughts. Here\u2019s a breakdown of your grammar and vocabulary usage:\n\n1. **Grammar**: \n   - Your sentences are mostly well-structured, but there are a couple of minor issues. For instance, the phrase \"I often make mistakes in my spoken English\" is correct, but you could enhance clarity by specifying \"in my spoken English skills.\"\n   - The example you provided, \"He don't like it,\" is a common mistake, and you correctly identified the correct form as \"He doesn't like it.\" This shows self-awareness in your language learning process.\n\n2. **Vocabulary**: \n   - Your vocabulary is appropriate for the context, and you use phrases like \"requires a lot of practice and dedication\" effectively. However, you could vary your word choice to enhance your writing. For example, instead of repeating \"I am good at math,\" you could say \"I excel in math\" or \"I have a strong aptitude for math.\"\n\n3. **Suggestions**:\n   - Consider expanding your sentences to include more complex structures. For example, you could say, \"Although I used to believe that learning a new language would be easy, I have come to understand that it demands significant practice and dedication.\"\n   - Pay attention to prepositions, as they can change the meaning of a sentence. Practicing with exercises focused on prepositions could help solidify your understanding.\n\n**Evaluation**: \nYour writing is coherent and conveys your message well. You demonstrate an awareness of your mistakes and a willingness to improve, which is commendable. \n\n**Score**: Based on the CET-6 standards, I would rate your writing at **B (75-80)**. You have a solid grasp of English, but there is room for improvement in complexity and precision. Keep practicing, and you'll continue to enhance your skills!",
        "Thank you for sharing your thoughts on learning English. Let's break down your writing according to the tasks outlined.\n\n### Grammar Mistakes:\n1. **\"He don't like it\"** should be corrected to **\"He doesn't like it.\"** The subject \"He\" requires the third-person singular form of the verb \"do.\"\n2. **\"I am good in math\"** should be corrected to **\"I am good at math.\"** The preposition \"at\" is the correct choice here.\n\n### Vocabulary Mistakes:\n- Your vocabulary usage is generally appropriate for the context. However, consider using \"struggle\" instead of \"trouble\" for a more nuanced expression of difficulty.\n\n### Evaluations:\nYour writing clearly expresses your reflections on language learning and identifies specific areas of difficulty. The structure is coherent, and your ideas are logically presented. \n\n### Suggestions:\n1. To improve your spoken English, consider practicing with native speakers or using language exchange apps.\n2. Focus on common verb forms and prepositions through targeted exercises or quizzes.\n3. Keep a journal of sentences where you notice mistakes, and review them regularly to reinforce correct usage.\n\n### Score According to CET-6 Standards:\nBased on the clarity of your ideas, the identification of specific mistakes, and the overall coherence of your writing, I would score your response around **B (75-80)**. To achieve a higher score, focus on correcting grammatical errors and enhancing your vocabulary usage.\n\nKeep practicing, and you'll continue to improve!"
