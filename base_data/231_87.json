It also provides a break from your routine and can help clear your mind.\n\n### 5. **Mindfulness Meditation (10-15 minutes daily)**\n   - **How to Practice:** Use a guided meditation app (like Headspace or Calm) or simply sit quietly and focus on your breath.

Opt for herbal teas or healthy snacks instead.\n   - **Why It Works:** Reducing stimulants can help stabilize your mood and energy levels, making it easier to cope with stress.\n\n### Conclusion\nIncorporating these strategies into your routine can help you manage stress more effectively.
