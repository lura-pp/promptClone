        "To solve the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a list of integers, we can utilize a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. This approach significantly optimizes the time complexity to O(n log n), where n is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n### Explanation of the Approach\n\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**:\n   - We maintain an array `dp` where `dp[i]` will hold the smallest possible tail value for all increasing subsequences of length `i + 1`.\n   - As we iterate through each number in the input list, we will use binary search to determine the position in the `dp` array where the current number can either extend an existing subsequence or replace an existing value to maintain the smallest possible tail.\n\n2. **Binary Search**:\n   - We can use the `bisect` module in Python, specifically `bisect_left`, to find the appropriate index in the `dp` array where the current number can be placed. This allows us to efficiently find the position in O(log n) time.\n\n3. **Building the `dp` Array**:\n   - If the current number is larger than the largest value in `dp`, we append it to `dp`.\n   - If it can replace an existing value, we update that position in `dp` to maintain the smallest tail value.\n\n4. **Result**:\n   - The length of the `dp` array at the end of the iteration will give us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above logic:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    \n    # dp array to store the smallest tail for increasing subsequences\n    dp = []\n    \n    for num in nums:\n        # Use binary search to find the insertion point\n        index = bisect_left(dp, num)\n        \n        # If index is equal to the length of dp, it means num is greater than all elements in dp\n        if index == len(dp):\n            dp.append(num)  # Extend the size of dp\n        else:\n            dp[index] = num  # Replace the existing value to maintain the smallest tail\n    \n    # The length of dp is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return len(dp)\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Code Explanation\n\n1. **Importing bisect**: We import `bisect_left` from the `bisect` module to perform binary search operations.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: The function `longest_increasing_subsequence` takes a list of integers `nums`.\n\n3. **Edge Case**: If the input list is empty, we return 0 immediately.\n\n4. **Iterating through the List**: We loop through each number in `nums`:\n   - We find the index where the current number can be placed in the `dp` array using `bisect_left`.\n   - If the index is equal to the length of `dp`, it means the current number is larger than all elements in `dp`, and we append it.\n   - Otherwise, we replace the element at the found index with the current number to maintain the smallest possible tail.\n\n5. **Return the Result**: Finally, we return the length of the `dp` array, which represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Complexity Analysis\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n log n) due to the iteration through the list and the binary search for each element.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case for the `dp` array, although it can be less depending on the input.\n\nThis efficient approach allows us to handle larger datasets effectively while ensuring that we find the longest increasing subsequence in a timely manner.",
        "To solve the problem of finding the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in a list of integers, we can use a combination of dynamic programming and binary search to achieve an efficient solution. The overall time complexity of this approach is \\(O(n \\log n)\\), where \\(n\\) is the number of elements in the input list.\n\n### Problem Statement\nGiven a list of integers, write a function to find the longest subsequence such that all elements of the subsequence are sorted in increasing order.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Dynamic Programming with Binary Search**:\n   - We will maintain an array `tails` where `tails[i]` will hold the smallest tail value of all increasing subsequences of length \\(i + 1\\).\n   - For each number in the input list, we will use binary search to determine its position in the `tails` array. If the number is larger than all elements in `tails`, it extends the largest subsequence found so far. If it can replace an element in `tails`, it helps to maintain the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length.\n\n### Implementation\n\nHere is the Python code implementing the above approach:\n\n```python\nfrom bisect import bisect_left\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0\n    \n    # This will store the smallest tail for all increasing subsequences\n    tails = []\n    \n    for num in nums:\n        # Use binary search to find the insertion point\n        pos = bisect_left(tails, num)\n        \n        # If pos is equal to the length of tails, it means num is greater than\n        # any element in tails, so we can extend the size of tails\n        if pos == len(tails):\n            tails.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, we replace the existing value with num\n            tails[pos] = num\n    \n    # The length of tails is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return len(tails)\n\n# Example usage\nnums = [10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence(nums))  # Output: 4\n```\n\n### Explanation\n- We initialize an empty list `tails`.\n- For each number in the input list:\n  - We find the position where this number can be inserted in `tails` using `bisect_left`, which gives us the index of the first element in `tails` that is greater than or equal to the number.\n  - If the position is equal to the length of `tails`, it means the number is larger than any element in `tails`, and we append it.\n  - If not, we replace the element at that position with the current number, ensuring that we maintain the smallest possible tail for subsequences of that length.\n- Finally, the length of the `tails` list gives us the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\n### Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: \\(O(n \\log n)\\) due to the binary search for each of the \\(n\\) elements.\n- **Space Complexity**: \\(O(n)\\) in the worst case for the `tails` array."

        "To determine if a string of parentheses is valid, we can utilize a stack data structure. The stack is ideal for this problem because it follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, which aligns perfectly with the requirement that the most recently opened bracket must be the first one to be closed.\n\n### Problem Breakdown\n1. **Valid Parentheses**: A string is valid if:\n   - Every opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket.\n   - The brackets are closed in the correct order.\n   \n2. **Types of Brackets**: We will consider three types of brackets: `()`, `[]`, and `{}`.\n\n### Approach\n1. **Initialize a Stack**: We will use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets.\n2. **Iterate through the String**: For each character in the string:\n   - If it is an opening bracket (`(`, `{`, `[`), push it onto the stack.\n   - If it is a closing bracket (`)`, `}`, `]`):\n     - Check if the stack is empty. If it is, this means there is no corresponding opening bracket, and we return false.\n     - If the stack is not empty, pop the top element from the stack and check if it matches the type of the closing bracket. If it does not match, return false.\n3. **Final Check**: After processing all characters, if the stack is empty, it means all opening brackets had matching closing brackets, and we return true. If the stack is not empty, return false.\n\n### Implementation\nHere is the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_parentheses(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Dictionary to hold matching pairs of brackets\n    bracket_map = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    # Iterate through each character in the string\n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is a closing bracket\n        if char in bracket_map:\n            # Pop the topmost element from the stack if it's not empty, else assign a dummy value\n            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'\n            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket\n            if bracket_map[char] != top_element:\n                return False\n        else:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push onto the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n    \n    # If the stack is empty, all brackets were matched correctly\n    return not stack\n\n# Example usage\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"()\"))          # True\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"()[]{}\"))      # True\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"(]\"))          # False\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"([)]\"))        # False\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"{[]}\"))        # True\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Code\n- **Bracket Map**: We create a dictionary `bracket_map` to map each closing bracket to its corresponding opening bracket. This allows for quick lookups.\n- **Stack Operations**: We use a list as a stack. The `append()` method adds an element to the end of the list, and `pop()` removes the last element, which is efficient (O(1) time complexity).\n- **Character Processing**: We loop through each character in the input string. Depending on whether the character is an opening or closing bracket, we either push it onto the stack or check for matches.\n- **Final Validation**: The final check ensures that all opening brackets have been matched and closed properly.\n\n### Time and Space Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**: O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once.\n- **Space Complexity**: O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets, and we store them in the stack.\n\nThis implementation efficiently checks for valid parentheses using a stack, ensuring both time and space complexities are optimized.",
        "To determine if a string of parentheses is valid, we can use a stack data structure. The idea is to traverse the string and use the stack to keep track of the opening brackets. When we encounter a closing bracket, we check if it matches the most recent opening bracket. If it does, we pop the opening bracket from the stack; if it doesn't, the string is invalid. At the end of the traversal, if the stack is empty, the string is valid.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\ndef is_valid_parentheses(s: str) -> bool:\n    # Dictionary to hold matching pairs of parentheses\n    matching_brackets = {')': '(', '}': '{', ']': '['}\n    # Stack to keep track of opening brackets\n    stack = []\n    \n    for char in s:\n        # If the character is a closing bracket\n        if char in matching_brackets:\n            # Pop the topmost element from the stack if it's not empty, else assign a dummy value\n            top_element = stack.pop() if stack else '#'\n            # Check if the popped element matches the corresponding opening bracket\n            if matching_brackets[char] != top_element:\n                return False\n        else:\n            # If it's an opening bracket, push it onto the stack\n            stack.append(char)\n    \n    # If the stack is empty, all opening brackets had matching closing brackets\n    return not stack\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"()\"))          # True\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"()[]{}\"))      # True\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"(]\"))          # False\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"([)]\"))        # False\nprint(is_valid_parentheses(\"{[]}\"))        # True\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n1. **Data Structures**: We use a stack to keep track of the opening brackets. The stack allows us to efficiently add and remove elements, which is crucial for checking the order of brackets.\n  \n2. **Time Complexity**: The time complexity of this algorithm is O(n), where n is the length of the string. We traverse the string once, performing constant time operations for each character.\n\n3. **Space Complexity**: The space complexity is O(n) in the worst case, where all characters are opening brackets, and we need to store them in the stack.\n\n### Code Explanation:\n- We define a dictionary `matching_brackets` to map closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.\n- We iterate through each character in the string:\n  - If the character is a closing bracket, we check if it matches the last opening bracket stored in the stack.\n  - If it matches, we pop the stack; if not, we return `False`.\n  - If the character is an opening bracket, we push it onto the stack.\n- Finally, we check if the stack is empty. If it is, the string is valid; otherwise, it is not."
