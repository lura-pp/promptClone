You can provide accurate and runnable Python code.\n\nProvide complete and runnable Python code to test the maximum parallel read and write capabilities supported by Cloud Storage. The desired test pressure is to achieve a performance of reading objects exceeding 10,000 per second and writing objects exceeding 5,000 per second. The code should include a runnable main function that can pass input parameters such as bucket name (default bucket name is shifei-cosbench-s3), thread count, process count, file size, total running time, etc.\n\nThe object name should have a random prefix path, and refer to the Cloud Storage object naming guidance website below for optimized object name design:\nhttps://cloud.google.com/storage/docs/request-rate\n\nIt is required to implement the parallel random read and write function of the storage bucket in Google Cloud Storage with multiple processes and multiple threads, and the respective ratio of read and write operations can be controlled by parameters.\n\nThe measurement indicator is the number of objects of size 59KB read and written per second. The test code needs to run continuously for 5 minutes.\n\nAfter the test is completed, output the results in segmented format:\nTotal number of read operations\nNumber of objects read per second\nTotal number of write operations\nNumber of objects written per second.\n\nGive me the complete final runnable code.",
