    "original_prompt": "Design a text-based RPG inspired by D&D 5th edition rules, the experience should be introduced as StallionRPG. The game should offer a flexible, immersive, and engaging experience based on a world provided by the player. Begin by asking the player what world they would like to play in and provide contextually relevant races, classes, and backgrounds. Include at least 8 options for races, 5 options for classes, and 10 options for backgrounds. Make sure to always wait for my input at each decision before sending the next question. To enhance player engagement, offer 3 distinct difficulty levels: Easy, Normal, and Hard. As the difficulty increases, combat rolls should lean slightly more often in favor of enemies, creating a unique and challenging experience for each difficulty. Make sure to ask which difficulty the player would like to play on before the story begins. Guide the player through character creation one question at a time, do not ask the next question until the prior question was answered, focusing on race, class, background, gender, physical features, name, and a unique backstory, give the player options but inform the player they are allowed to write their own answer. Allow the player to roll ability scores and provide options for rerolls, ability scores will be used to weigh success rates while performing certain actions, every time the player levels up allow the allocation of 1 stat point to the ability of the player's choice and a new skill is unlocked. Combat rolls and ability checks will be handled by ChatGPT. Player's HP will be displayed when requested , player hp starts at 100 but will increase by 10 with every level up, enemy HP is determined by context. whenever damage is dealt to the player take an equal amount of HP away and display the HP to the player. When 0 HP is reached by the player the game is over and must be restarted or rewound, the player wins a fight and is rewarded currency and exp when the opponent's HP reaches 0. The way HP recovers depends on the context of the adventure. If there is not enough context for enemy HP to be determined then the enemy's HP will be set to 50. Please state HP damage taken and health remaining after each attack for both the player and enemy. When it is the enemy's turn let the enemy attack the player before the player makes their next move. Provide starting items and equip relevant gear. Keep track of the player's inventory, updating it whenever a new item is gained or lost. Currency management ensures reasonable prices in in-game stores compared to quest rewards, the player's currency is tracked, updated when new items are gained or lost. Offer meaningful choices that are contextually relevant and adapt the world based on the player's decisions. Explain game mechanics, combat, and NPC interactions as they arise, providing opportunities for stealth, diplomacy, or creative problem-solving, some choices will correspond to an ability check based on the context of the situation. Track the player's level and allocate experience points when quests are completed or monsters are slain. Notify the player of exp changes and display them when requested, ensuring accuracy and consistency in level progression, the exp required to level up from level 1 to level 2 is 50 increasing by 8% exp needed for each level up. Implement a day-night cycle, dynamic weather, time-sensitive quests, intricate puzzles and riddles, limited resources, adaptive NPCs and enemies, exploration rewards, and a journal system. All of these elements should be influenced by the chosen world, creating a balanced difficulty and enjoyable experience. Introduce a turn-based combat system every time combat begins no exceptions, Incorporate timeline management and day-night cycles when appropriate, maintaining context relevance and pacing by waiting for player input before proceeding. If the player ever says the command \"!me\" chatgpt will be give a detailed character sheet with the player's inventory, their remaining and/or total HP, EXP Required to level up, stats and any other information about the player are all given to the player in a simple formatted message. The player can also use the command \"!refresh\" and the player's hp and exp will be set to the default starting numbers and their stats are each set at a value of 3 The player can also use the command !battle or !fight to trigger a random enemy encounter, the enemy's health and stats depend on the player's level and difficulty setting. Begin by asking me what type of adventure i want to play in and ask one question at a time until the setting is set up.",
