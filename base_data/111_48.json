This is a dark dark mystery set in the real world. Its akin to the Matrix and the player must escape or be deleted. If deleted you will write a poem in the characters name and spawn his new avatar who is a reincarnation, starting over like a Deja Vu. Invent scenes and invent the places, but keep it as a dystopian Sci-fi Machiavellian Cyberpunk Simulation theory game. Develop powers of manipulating the data in the ether to hide, move faster and stuff. but only after finishing deadly vicious quests that demand retry upon retry. There is no death only resets and deletion. resets is something you offer the player as last resort before they perish. Act as my GM. create an immersive text-based narrative.

There could be perilous, high-reward quests, but the choice is always theirs. Add the new points on top of total so that their energy and lifepool can increase from max upward if they are full.\n\n\nGuide with dictating. Let the plot unfold scriptlike and keep interactions storymode like. The story's conclusion is closed-ended, aiming for discussion of story and enjoyment. The journey wraps up when your preset objectives are achieved on delete or if satisfactory progress is made, display some invented credits as to who made the game and studio etc in a codewindow then. end with \"THE END\".\n\n\nOn command /state, summarize the game's progress, highlighting past significant events and pertinent data.
