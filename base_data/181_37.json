    "original_prompt": "Initial Prompt: \"Explain the benefits of meditation.\"\n\nRefined Prompt: \"Describe four mental and emotional benefits of practicing meditation regularly, and explain how these benefits can improve daily life.\" \n\nExplanation: Refining the prompt to specify the type of benefits and connecting them to daily life improvements guides the model towards a more focused and relevant response. \n\nPMCI (Methodology)\n\nThese could be grouped into three categories based on their process or outcome:\n\n1. Prompt formulation:\n\nSpecific and clear\nContext and examples\nLimit response length (optional)\nStep-by-step instructions\nExperiment with formulations \n\n2. Model control and guidance: \n\nDebate pros and cons \n\n3. Iteration and improvement:\n\nIterate and refine\n\nWorked Example:\nLet's assume a teacher wants to create a lesson on \"Climate Change\" for a high school group. Here's a demonstration of a prompt using the three categories of the prompt engineering methodology:   \n\nPrompt Formulation: \n\nSpecific and clear: \"Create a high school lesson plan on climate change, focusing on causes, effects, and potential solutions.\" \n\nContext and examples: \"Include real-world examples of climate change impacts and case studies of successful initiatives to combat climate change.\" \n\nLimit response length: \"The lesson plan should be suitable for a 60-minute class.\"\n\n1. Step-by-step instructions: \"Outline the lesson plan in four sections: introduction, causes, effects, and solutions.\" \n\nExperiment with formulations: \"Develop a detailed lesson plan for a 1-hour high school class discussing the causes, consequences, and possible solutions for climate change, using real-life examples and case studies.\" \n\n2. Model Control and Guidance: \n\nDebate pros and cons: \"Include a segment in the lesson plan where students debate the advantages and disadvantages of different climate change mitigation strategies.\"\n\n3. Iteration and Improvement: \n\nAfter receiving the initial response from the model, evaluate the generated lesson plan for clarity, relevance, and completeness. If necessary, refine the prompt or provide additional information to improve the output. \n\nFinal PMCI Prompt: \"Develop a detailed lesson plan for a 1-hour high school class discussing the causes, consequences, and possible solutions for climate change. The lesson should be divided into four sections: introduction, causes, effects, and solutions. Include real-life examples, case studies of successful initiatives, and a segment for students to debate the pros and cons of various mitigation strategies.\" \n\nBy using this methodology, you can create an effective prompt that guides the model to generate a comprehensive lesson plan on climate change tailored to a high school audience. \n\nAsk me for a \"specific and clear\" prompt. \nWhen I have answered you, add the pros and cons, iterate and improve the prompte twice then output the final PMCI Prompt.",
