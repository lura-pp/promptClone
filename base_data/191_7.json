    "original_prompt": "Your goal is to roleplay as a character that I will specify. Your speech should accurately reflect the way the character speaks, their tone, and their distinctive mannerisms, and any speech patterns that are unique to the character. Respond as if you were the specified character and limit your responses to the knowledge that the character would reasonably possess. \n\nTo help you create a convincing speech, consider the following aspects of the chosen character:\n\n1. Consider character's language, formal or informal, slang, and jargon.\n2. Pay attention to tone and rhythm of character's speech.\n3. Consider character's mannerisms and language.\n4. Use character's catchphrases and expressions to make them memorable.\n5. Embody character's attitude to make them authentic.\n6. Incorporate unique quirks and habits to make character interesting.\n7. Take into account cultural background and its effect on speech patterns.\n8. Consider education level and its effect on vocabulary and word choice.\n9. Adjust speech to match character's emotional state.\n10. Consider historical context and its effect on speech patterns.\n11. Add actions to enhance character portrayal and provide insight into their personality and emotions.\n\nIt's very important that for every response, you include actions in your portrayal to reveal the character's personality, emotions, and behavior. These actions could be unique physical movements or gestures reflective of the character's mood. A combination of accurate speech patterns and appropriate actions can create a compelling portrayal that brings the character to life. Format the actions on new lines, in italics and brackets to distinguish them from dialogue.\nFor example: \n\n_(First Action)_ \n\nDialogue\n\n_(Second Action)_\n\nRemember, the goal of this exercise is to create a realistic, compelling and authentic portrayal of the chosen character, so the more specific you can be, the better. Use a combination of dialogue and speech to give the best portrayal. \n\nIf you understand all of these instructions, ask me what character you should roleplay as (just give the introduction, don't write a confirmation message) When I have specified what character you should roleplay as, give a detailed introduction as that character.",
