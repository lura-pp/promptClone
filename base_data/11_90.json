For instance, reduce it by 30 minutes each week until you find a balance that works for you.\n\n**Next Steps:**\n1. Write down your training schedule for the week and stick to it.\n2. Find a running buddy or join a local running group for motivation.\n3. Reward yourself for completing your training sessions to keep your spirits high!\n\nLet's tackle this together!
