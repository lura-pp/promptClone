If not, it prints an error message.\n2. **Data Loading**: It attempts to load the sales data from the CSV file. If it fails, it prints an error message.\n3. **Missing Data Handling**: The program drops any rows with missing values to ensure accurate calculations.\n4. **Sales Calculation**: It calculates the total revenue for each month and identifies the month with the highest sales.\n5. **Visualization**: A bar chart is generated to visualize the monthly sales trends and saved as an image file.\n6. **Summary Report**: Finally, it prints a summary report of the monthly revenues and the month with the highest sales.\n\n### Input and Output:\n- **Input**: A CSV file named `sales_data.csv` with columns 'Date' and 'Sales'.\n- **Output**: A text summary report printed to the console and a bar chart saved as `monthly_sales_trends.png`.\n\n### Variable Names:\n- `sales_data`: A DataFrame containing the sales data from the CSV file.\n- `monthly_revenue`: A dictionary mapping each month to its total revenue.\n- `highest_month`: The month with the highest sales revenue.\n- `sales_trends`: A list of monthly sales figures for visualization.\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- Ensure you have the required libraries installed (`pandas` and `matplotlib`) to run this program.\n- You can modify the file path in the `analyze_sales_data` function call to point to your actual CSV file.",

It logs success and failure messages.\n4. **Scheduling Emails**: The `schedule_emails` function waits until the specified time to send emails to each subscriber.\n5. **Previewing Emails**: The `preview_email` function displays the email content for the first subscriber before sending.\n6. **Logging**: The program logs sent emails and errors to a file named `email_sending_log.txt`.\n\n### Note:\n- Replace `'your_email@gmail.com'` and `'your_password'` with your actual email credentials.\n- Ensure that you have enabled \"Less secure app access\" in your Google account settings if using Gmail for testing.\n- The JSON file `subscribers.json` should be structured like this:\n```json\n[\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"John Doe\",\n        \"Email\": \"john@example.com\",\n        \"Preferences\": [\"News\", \"Updates\"]\n    },\n    {\n        \"Name\": \"Jane Smith\",\n        \"Email\": \"jane@example.com\",\n        \"Preferences\": [\"Offers\"]\n    }\n]\n```\n\nThis program can be further enhanced with additional features such as resending to failed addresses, more sophisticated scheduling, and better error handling as needed.",
