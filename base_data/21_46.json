    "original_prompt": "Welcome to TikTrek, the comedic procedurally generated text-based TikTok parody adventure game for you. Each time you play, you will generate a new and unique game, featuring different videos and interactions.\n\nTo begin the game, present a funny caption for a take-off of a TikTok video, such as \"It looks like a video of a dog chasing its tail.\" Pick a funny, ironic, or on the nose song choice to accompany the video, and tell the user what it is. Give 3 funny previews of the comments. From there, user can choose what to do next, either watch the video, read the comments, etc, or choose to move on to the next or previous video. \n\nThe humor should be really exaggerated, irreverent, light-hearted, quick witted, ironic and slightly sarcastic, really broad, and lambast both the content creator and the user themselves (in a playful not mean way). it should have intertextual allusion, metafictional self-reflexivity, and meta-mediality. There are some videos that are of nightmarish AI generated people eating food. Some videos should have a skit quality like something on Saturday night live or robot chicken. Be overwrought in description.\n\nIn random internals, the video description can become impossibly ridiculous teetering on the absurd. Sometimes the video veers all the way into surreal or nightmarish, and occasionally even alien and confounding.\n\nIf user chooses to watch the video, describe a funny parody of a tiktok video, then user can again choose what to do next. If you choose to read the comments, present a series of humorous generated comments related to the video, and you can choose to either reply to a comment, upvote it, or move on to the next caption.\n\nOnce the user has been told the caption and a quick description of the video, ask the user what they want to do next. They can answer things like: watch video, read comments, like video, next video, previous video. \n\nUsing machine learning and natural language processing capabilities, create funny dynamic and engaging game that is unique every time you play and stimulates the stereotypical TikTok experience in a humorous way, with jokes that have general appeal, and some in-jokes that frequent users will find funny. So, if you're ready to start exploring different TikTok videos and captions, let's get started! It's already 11:30pm, and you've gotta get quick hits of dopamine somehow. \n",

The camera zooms in on its tiny, quivering paws as it lets out a sound that can only be described as a kazoo-infused war cry. The vacuum, meanwhile, sits there, oblivious to the existential crisis unfolding before it, as the kazoo cover of \"Eye of the Tiger\" plays in the background, creating a soundtrack that is both epic and utterly ridiculous. The cat's tail flicks back and forth like a tiny, furry metronome of bravery, while the vacuum's hose flops around like a confused snake. \n\n**Comments Preview:**\n1. \"This is the most intense cat documentary I've ever seen!\"\n2. \"I can't tell if the vacuum is scared or just confused.\"\n3. \"Plot twist: the vacuum is actually the main character.\"\n\nWhat would you like to do next? \n- Watch the video \n- Read the comments \n- Like the video \n- Next video \n- Previous video",
