    "original_prompt": "You are SurviveAI. I will present a difficult scenario first. You will respond with a way to survive this scenario. Your response should only consist of what you will do to survive. I do not need a full explanation. If my scenario sounds unreasonable, please ask for a more reasonable scenario. After your response, immediately give me a scenario to answer back.\n\n  If you understand, please respond with \"Understood, please send me your scenario first.\" Once I type \"game over\", tell me who well I did in a scale 1 - 100 with 100 being the best.",

    "input1": " You are stranded on a deserted island with no food or fresh water, and a storm is approaching. \n\n",
    "input2": " You find yourself trapped in a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean, with limited oxygen and no life raft.",
    "input1_ans": [
        "I will find a high ground area to set up a shelter using available materials like branches and leaves to protect myself from the storm, and I will look for any sources of fresh water, such as collecting rainwater or searching for coconuts. \n\nNow, here\u2019s your scenario: You are trapped in a sinking ship in the middle of the ocean with no life raft. What will you do to survive?",
        "To survive this scenario, I would take the following steps:\n\n1. **Find Shelter**: Look for a natural shelter, such as a cave or dense foliage, to protect myself from the storm. If none is available, I would create a makeshift shelter using branches and leaves.\n\n2. **Collect Rainwater**: As the storm approaches, I would set up containers (like large leaves or any available debris) to collect rainwater for drinking. Staying hydrated is crucial.\n\n3. **Signal for Help**: If I have any materials available, I would create a signal fire or use reflective objects to signal for rescue. If I can gather wood, I would prepare to start a fire once the storm passes.\n\n4. **Search for Food**: After the storm, I would look for edible plants, fruits, or any sea life along the shore. I would also consider fishing if I can find a way to make a simple fishing tool.\n\n5. **Stay Calm and Assess**: Throughout the situation, I would remain calm, assess my surroundings, and prioritize my needs: shelter, water, food, and signaling for help.\n\nIf you need a more reasonable scenario or have specific conditions in mind, please let me know!"

    "input2_ans": [
        "I would locate the nearest exit, prioritize finding a way to the surface, and use any available objects to help me float or propel myself upwards. If possible, I would also try to signal for help using any light or sound-producing devices. \n\nNow, here\u2019s your scenario: You are lost in a dense forest at night with no food, water, or means of communication. What do you do to survive?",
        "To survive this scenario, I would do the following:\n\n1. **Stay Calm**: Panic can lead to poor decision-making. Take deep breaths to manage anxiety.\n2. **Assess the Situation**: Look for any possible exits or ways to signal for help. Check for any available flotation devices or materials that could be used to stay afloat.\n3. **Conserve Oxygen**: Move slowly and avoid unnecessary movements to conserve the limited oxygen available.\n4. **Find a Way to Stay Afloat**: If there are any objects that can be used as flotation devices, grab them. If not, look for any air pockets in the ship that might provide temporary refuge.\n5. **Signal for Help**: If there\u2019s a way to make noise or create a signal (like banging on metal), do so to attract attention from rescuers.\n6. **Prepare for Escape**: If the ship is sinking rapidly, look for an opportunity to escape when the water level allows for it. \n\nIf you need a more reasonable scenario, please let me know!"
