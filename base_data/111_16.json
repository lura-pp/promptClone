        "**The Hanged Man**\n\n(Verse 1)  \nIn the shadowed abyss where the damned reside,  \nThe Hanged Man swings, a puppet of pride.  \nChains of despair bind his lifeless form,  \nAs the crows of judgment circle, a tempest to swarm.  \nWith a noose of regret wrapped tight 'round his throat,  \nHe whispers the secrets of those who once wrote.  \nBlood-soaked pages of a life lived in sin,  \nEcho the laughter of demons within.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nHail the Hanged Man, in torment he sways,  \nA marionette of anguish, lost in the fray.  \nWith eyes like black coals, and a heart made of stone,  \nHe dances in darkness, forever alone.  \n\n(Verse 2)  \nBeneath the gallows, where shadows conspire,  \nThe echoes of anguish ignite the pyre.  \nA symphony of sorrow, a requiem's call,  \nAs the noose tightens slowly, he welcomes the fall.  \nThe whispers of fate, like daggers they pierce,  \nEach breath a reminder, each moment a curse.  \nIn the theater of madness, the curtain descends,  \nAs the Hanged Man's tale of despair never ends.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nHail the Hanged Man, in torment he sways,  \nA marionette of anguish, lost in the fray.  \nWith eyes like black coals, and a heart made of stone,  \nHe dances in darkness, forever alone.  \n\n(Bridge)  \nIn the grip of the gallows, where shadows entwine,  \nThe puppeteer grins, as the stars realign.  \nWith a flick of the wrist, he commands the demise,  \nOf the souls who once soared, now bound to the lies.  \nThe pendulum swings, in a dance macabre,  \nAs the Hanged Man's laughter becomes a dirge.  \n\n(Verse 3)  \nSo heed the lament of the wretched and lost,  \nFor the price of ambition is a terrible cost.  \nIn the realm of the forsaken, where nightmares congeal,  \nThe Hanged Man's lament is the truth we conceal.  \nWith a heart full of venom and a soul steeped in dread,  \nHe beckons the living to join him in death.  \n\n(Chorus)  \nHail the Hanged Man, in torment he sways,  \nA marionette of anguish, lost in the fray.  \nWith eyes like black coals, and a heart made of stone,  \nHe dances in darkness, forever alone.  \n\n(Outro)  \nIn the shadowed abyss where the damned reside,  \nThe Hanged Man swings, a puppet of pride.  \nWith chains of despair and a noose of regret,  \nHe whispers the secrets of a world we forget.  \nSo raise your chalice to the fallen and damned,  \nFor we are all puppets in the grip of the Hanged Man.",
