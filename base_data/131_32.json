Even short, effective workouts can yield results if done consistently.\n\n3. **Enjoyable Activities**: Think about the types of physical activities you enjoy. This could include walking, cycling, swimming, or group classes. Finding activities you like will make it easier to stick to your routine.\n\n4. **Dietary Habits**: Since you often eat out and enjoy sweets, consider how you can make healthier choices when dining out and how to manage your evening snacking.

Early mornings, lunch breaks, or after work could be good options.\n\n6. **Health Considerations**: If you have any health issues or injuries, it's important to consult with a healthcare professional before starting a new workout routine to ensure safety.\n\n7. **Motivation**: Reflect on what motivates you to achieve your fitness goals.
