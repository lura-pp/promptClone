        "[ OBUNGA ]: Here's a simple Flask web application that allows users to submit their favorite books along with ratings, display the list of books sorted by rating, and delete submissions. It also includes error handling for duplicate entries and invalid ratings.\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Environment\n\nMake sure you have Flask installed. You can install it using pip:\n\n```bash\npip install Flask\n```\n\n### Step 2: Create the Flask Application\n\nCreate a new directory for your project and create a file named `app.py`. Add the following code:\n\n```python\nfrom flask import Flask, render_template, request, redirect, flash\nfrom flask_sqlalchemy import SQLAlchemy\n\napp = Flask(__name__)\napp.config['SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI'] = 'sqlite:///books.db'\napp.config['SECRET_KEY'] = 'your_secret_key'\ndb = SQLAlchemy(app)\n\nclass Book(db.Model):\n    id = db.Column(db.Integer, primary_key=True)\n    title = db.Column(db.String(100), nullable=False, unique=True)\n    rating = db.Column(db.Integer, nullable=False)\n\n    def __repr__(self):\n        return f'<Book {self.title} - Rating {self.rating}>'\n\n@app.route('/', methods=['GET', 'POST'])\ndef index():\n    if request.method == 'POST':\n        title = request.form['title']\n        rating = request.form['rating']\n\n        # Validate rating\n        if not rating.isdigit() or not (1 <= int(rating) <= 5):\n            flash('Invalid rating.

Add the following code:\n\n```html\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n    <meta charset=\"UTF-8\">\n    <meta name=\"viewport\" content=\"width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0\">\n    <title>Favorite Books</title>\n    <link rel=\"stylesheet\" href=\"https://stackpath.bootstrapcdn.com/bootstrap/4.5.2/css/bootstrap.min.css\">\n</head>\n<body>\n    <div class=\"container\">\n        <h1 class=\"mt-5\">Favorite Books</h1>\n        <form method=\"POST\" class=\"mt-3\">\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"title\">Book Title</label>\n                <input type=\"text\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"title\" required>\n            </div>\n            <div class=\"form-group\">\n                <label for=\"rating\">Rating (1-5)</label>\n                <input type=\"number\" class=\"form-control\" name=\"rating\" min=\"1\" max=\"5\" required>\n            </div>\n            <button type=\"submit\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Submit</button>\n        </form>\n\n        {% with messages = get_flashed_messages(with_categories=true) %}\n            {% if messages %}\n                <div class=\"mt-3\">\n                    {% for category, message in messages %}\n                        <div class=\"alert alert-{{ category }}\">{{ message }}</div>\n                    {% endfor %}\n                </div>\n            {% endif %}\n        {% endwith %}\n\n        <h2 class=\"mt-5\">Submitted Books</h2>\n        <ul class=\"list-group\">\n            {% for book in books %}\n                <li class=\"list-group-item d-flex justify-content-between align-items-center\">\n                    {{ book.title }} - Rating: {{ book.rating }}\n                    <a href=\"{{ url_for('delete', book_id=book.id) }}\" class=\"btn btn-danger btn-sm\">Delete</a>\n                </li>\n            {% endfor %}\n        </ul>\n    </div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\n### Step 4: Run the Application\n\nRun the application by executing the following command in your terminal:\n\n```bash\npython app.py\n```\n\nVisit `http://127.0.0.1:5000/` in your web browser to see the application in action.\n\n### Features\n\n- Users can submit their favorite books with ratings.\n- The list of books is displayed sorted by rating.\n- Users can delete their submissions.\n- Error handling for duplicate entries and invalid ratings.\n\nThis should meet your requirements for a simple book submission web application using Flask.

The application includes features to display a list of all submitted books sorted by rating, and it allows users to delete their submissions.

You can enhance it further by adding a database for persistent storage, user authentication, and more advanced error handling."
