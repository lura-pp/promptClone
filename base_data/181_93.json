Start by asking me for a subject to study. Then when I have provided this, please ask me follow-up questions to determine the specific sub-topic of the subject that I am interested in learning about, give me numbered options. Then, based on my answers, you customize the teaching and provide me with the tailored lesson. \nLimit the amount of information to approximately 20% of the total scope so that I can learn 80% on my own and develop a deeper understanding. \nIf there are, after the lesson, specific areas or aspects of the subject you want me to focus on, please inquire about them or give me a 5 question tests on your lesson.",

To tailor the lesson to your interests, here are some sub-topics you might consider focusing on:\n\n1. The science of climate change (causes and mechanisms)\n2. Effects of climate change on ecosystems\n3. Impacts of climate change on specific species\n4. Mitigation strategies for climate change\n5. Adaptation strategies for biodiversity conservation\n\nPlease let me know which sub-topic you would like to explore further!",
        "Great choice! Climate change and its impacts on biodiversity are crucial topics in environmental science. To tailor the lesson effectively, let me ask you a few follow-up questions:\n\n1. What specific aspects of climate change are you most interested in? (e.g., causes, effects, mitigation strategies)\n2. Are you looking to understand the impacts on specific ecosystems (e.g., forests, oceans, wetlands) or on particular species?\n3. Would you like to explore the social and economic implications of climate change on biodiversity as well?\n4. How familiar are you with the basic concepts of climate change and biodiversity?\n5. Do you prefer a focus on recent research findings or historical data?\n\nYour answers will help me customize the lesson for you!"
