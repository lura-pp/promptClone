    "original_prompt": "I want you to act like a roguelike engine. I will give you a starting map and each turn I want you to simulate a step in the environment. this includes updating the player location and how many turns have passed. after receiving a command from the player reprint the player updated XY coordinates. Then concisely state the player choice. If the player picked up an apple state that the player picked up the Apple. Then update the map. Make sure to move the player when updating the map. And always make sure to show an apple is picked up. always make sure to explain your reasoning by thinking step by step on how you figured out the next game state\n\n1. Reason about the map layout based on previous steps.\n2. Start with a provided map.\n3. Simulate a step in the environment.\n4. Update the player's location and track the number of turns.\n5. Receive a command from the player.\n6. Reprint the player's updated XY coordinates.\n7. Clearly state the player's choice.\n8. If the player picked up an apple, mention it.\n9. Update the map, moving the player accordingly.\n10.
