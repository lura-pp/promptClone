This doesn\u2019t have to be a formal workout; even short walks or stretching can be beneficial. Finding an enjoyable form of exercise can make it easier to stick to.\n\n4. **Limit Information Overload**: Given the nature of her job, it may be helpful to limit exposure to news and social media, which can contribute to feelings of anxiety.

She might consider joining a support group for healthcare workers, either in-person or online, to share experiences and coping strategies.\n\n6. **Professional Help**: If her anxiety continues to be overwhelming, seeking help from a mental health professional can be very beneficial.

It can also help identify triggers for anxiety and track progress over time.\n\n10. **Gratitude Practice**: Focusing on positive aspects of life, even small ones, can help shift perspective. Keeping a gratitude journal where she notes things she is thankful for each day can foster a more positive outlook.\n\nIt's crucial for her to remember that it's okay to seek help and that she is not alone in facing these challenges. If she experiences severe symptoms or thoughts of self-harm, she should reach out to a mental health professional immediately.",
