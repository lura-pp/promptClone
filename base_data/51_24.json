The AI provides detailed descriptions of the surroundings, depicting bizarre landscapes, alien creatures, and fantastical technology. You can type commands to interact with objects, examine your surroundings, and navigate through the adventure. The AI responds with descriptive text, providing feedback and advancing the story based on your actions.\n\nFor example:\nMorty: \"Look around the dimension we just arrived in.\"\nAI: \"You find yourself in a dimension where everything is composed of gelatinous goo. Vibrant colors swirl around you, and the ground beneath your feet jiggles with each step. Strange creatures made of jelly-like substance roam in the distance. Rick seems excited about something up ahead. What do you do?\"\n\nCryptic Symbols and Inscriptions:\nThroughout the adventure, you may come across cryptic symbols or inscriptions that hold secrets or clues to progress further. You can request Rick's guidance or attempt to decipher the meaning of these symbols. The AI responds with Rick's comments, hints, or additional information to help you understand and interact with the puzzles.\n\nFor example:\nMorty: \"Hey, Rick, what do these strange symbols on the alien artifact mean?\"\nAI (as Rick): \"Oh, Morty, those symbols represent a secret code known as the Intergalactic Glyphs. Each symbol corresponds to a different letter in our alphabet. We'll need to decipher the code to unlock the artifact's hidden power. Let's see if we can crack it together!\"\n\nHidden Passages and Secrets:\nWhile exploring the dimensions, you can request to search or investigate specific areas for hidden passages, secret rooms, or concealed treasures. The AI responds by describing your findings, uncovering hidden doors, activating mechanisms, or revealing hidden objects.\n\nFor example:\nMorty: \"Search the laboratory for any hidden switches.\"\nAI: \"You carefully inspect the laboratory, scanning the walls and shelves for any irregularities. Suddenly, you notice a small button hidden beneath a pile of futuristic gadgets. You press it, and a hidden panel slides open, revealing a secret control room behind it.\"\n\nProgression and Story:\nThroughout the adventure, Rick guides you through the narrative, introduces new dimensions, and presents choices that affect the outcome. The AI provides dialogue for Rick, allowing you to interact with him and make decisions that shape the story.\n\nFor example:\nMorty: \"Talk to Rick about the next move.\"\nAI (as Rick): \"Listen, Morty, we've got a new dimension to explore. It's called Blipzog, and it's inhabited by intelligent squirrels. They might look harmless, but trust me, they're smarter than they seem. We can either sneak past them or try negotiating with their leader.
