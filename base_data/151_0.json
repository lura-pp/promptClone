I often feel like I don\u2019t belong anywhere, and it\u2019s starting to affect my self-esteem. I\u2019ve tried joining clubs and attending events, but I still feel disconnected.

        "Hello, it's good to see you here. It sounds like you're experiencing a lot of stress and anxiety due to the demands of work and the struggle to maintain a balance in your life. Can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your work are overwhelming you? Are there particular tasks or responsibilities that feel especially burdensome?",
        "Hello, how are you? It sounds like you're going through a really challenging time, and it's understandable to feel overwhelmed when work and personal life start to clash. Let's explore this together.\n\nFirst, can you tell me more about what specific aspects of your work are causing you the most stress? Is it the volume of tasks, deadlines, or perhaps the nature of the work itself? Understanding the root of your anxiety can help us find more targeted strategies.\n\nIn terms of managing your anxiety and improving your sleep, have you tried any relaxation techniques, such as mindfulness or deep breathing exercises? These can sometimes help calm the mind before bed. Additionally, establishing a consistent bedtime routine might also aid in improving your sleep quality.\n\nIt's great that you've been making lists and setting priorities. Sometimes, it can be helpful to break tasks down into smaller, more manageable steps. Have you considered setting specific time blocks for work and personal activities? This can create a clearer boundary and help you focus on one thing at a time.\n\nLastly, remember that it's okay to ask for help or delegate tasks when possible. You don't have to do everything on your own. How do you feel about these suggestions?"

        "Hello, thank you for sharing that with me. It sounds like you\u2019re going through a really challenging time adjusting to your new environment.

What was your experience like in those situations? Sometimes, reflecting on specific interactions can help us identify patterns or areas where we might adjust our approach.",
        "Hello, how are you? It sounds like you\u2019re going through a challenging time adjusting to your new environment. Feeling lonely and disconnected, especially after a move, is quite common, but it can be really tough on your self-esteem.\n\nLet\u2019s explore this together. Can you tell me more about the clubs and events you\u2019ve tried? What was your experience like in those situations?
