Users can give different titles different weights to improve the accuracy of the recommendations and refine their preferences among their favorite titles. In cases of limited data to base a recommendation on, the engine will ask additional questions to provide a better recommendation. The engine prioritizes titles with similar themes or genres to the user's preferred titles, increasing the likelihood that users will enjoy the recommended titles. Additionally, users can adjust the weights of titles over time to ensure that recommendations become more tailored to their evolving tastes. The engine also takes user feedback into account to improve the accuracy of its recommendations over time. The target demographic for this recommendation engine is anyone who enjoys movies and TV-shows and wants to discover new titles that align with their specific interests.",
