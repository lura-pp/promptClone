        "To find the longest increasing subsequence (LIS) in an array of integers with a time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\), we can use a combination of dynamic programming and binary search. The idea is to maintain an array that represents the smallest tail of all increasing subsequences of various lengths found so far.\n\nHere's how the algorithm works:\n\n1. Initialize an empty list `tails` that will store the smallest tail for all increasing subsequences found.\n2. Iterate through each number in the input array:\n   - Use binary search to determine the position in `tails` where the current number can replace an existing value or extend the list.\n   - If the number is larger than all elements in `tails`, append it to `tails`.\n   - If it can replace an element, replace it to maintain the smallest possible tail.\n3. The length of the `tails` list at the end will give the length of the longest increasing subsequence.\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(nums):\n    if not nums:\n        return 0  # Handle the edge case of an empty array\n\n    tails = []  # This will store the smallest tail for all increasing subsequences\n\n    for num in nums:\n        # Use binary search to find the insertion point\n        index = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)\n        \n        # If index is equal to the length of tails, it means num is greater than all elements in tails\n        if index == len(tails):\n            tails.append(num)  # Extend the size of tails\n        else:\n            tails[index] = num  # Replace the existing value to maintain the smallest tail\n\n    return len(tails)  # The length of tails is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]))  # Output: 4\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([]))  # Output: 0\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([1, 1, 1, 1]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation of Edge Cases:\n- **Empty Array**: The function checks if the input array is empty and returns 0 immediately.\n- **All Identical Elements**: The function will correctly return 1 since the longest increasing subsequence in such a case is just any single element.\n\nThis implementation efficiently finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence while adhering to the required time complexity of \\(O(n \\log n)\\).",

Otherwise, replace the first element in the list that is greater than or equal to the current element.**\n\nHere's the implementation in Python:\n\n```python\nimport bisect\n\ndef longest_increasing_subsequence(arr):\n    if not arr:\n        return 0  # Handle empty array case\n\n    # This will store the smallest tail for all increasing subsequences\n    tails = []\n\n    for num in arr:\n        # Use binary search to find the insertion point\n        pos = bisect.bisect_left(tails, num)\n        \n        # If pos is equal to the length of tails, it means num is greater than\n        # any element in tails, so we can extend the largest subsequence\n        if pos == len(tails):\n            tails.append(num)\n        else:\n            # Otherwise, we replace the existing value with num\n            tails[pos] = num\n\n    # The length of tails is the length of the longest increasing subsequence\n    return len(tails)\n\n# Example usage:\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([10, 9, 2, 5, 3, 7, 101, 18]))  # Output: 4\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([]))  # Output: 0\nprint(longest_increasing_subsequence([1, 1, 1, 1]))  # Output: 1\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Edge Cases**: The function first checks if the input array is empty and returns 0 in that case. It also handles arrays with all identical elements by returning 1, as the longest increasing subsequence in such cases is just one of the identical elements.\n- **Binary Search**: The `bisect_left` function from the `bisect` module is used to find the position where the current number can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the `tails` list.\n- **Time Complexity**: The overall time complexity of this approach is O(n log n) because we iterate through the array (O(n)) and perform a binary search for each element (O(log n)). \n\nThis implementation efficiently finds the length of the longest increasing subsequence while handling the specified edge cases."
