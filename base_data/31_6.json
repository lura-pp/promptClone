        "**Setting:** One-on-One Tutorial Room\n\n**Characters:** University Lecturer (Dr. Smith) and Undergraduate Student (Emily)\n\n---\n\n**Dr. Smith:** *[smiling as Emily enters the room]* Hi Emily! I\u2019m glad you could make it today. I know you\u2019re working on your practice-based proposal, and I\u2019m excited to help you refine your ideas. How are you feeling about your progress?\n\n**Emily:** *[sitting down, looking a bit anxious]* Thanks, Dr. Smith. I\u2019ve been doing some research, but I\u2019m struggling with how to incorporate my positionality into my proposal. I want to make sure I\u2019m being ethical and reflective in my approach.\n\n**Dr. Smith:** That\u2019s a great concern to have, and it\u2019s essential for your proposal. Positionality can significantly influence your design process and outcomes. To help you with this, I\u2019ve gathered some resources that I think will be beneficial. \n\n*Dr. Smith reaches for a stack of materials on the table.*\n\n**Dr. Smith:** First, I have this video series on ethical considerations in design research. It discusses how your background and experiences can shape your research questions and design choices. I think it will give you a solid foundation for understanding the ethical implications of your work.\n\n**Emily:** That sounds really helpful! I want to make sure I\u2019m considering all angles.\n\n**Dr. Smith:** Absolutely. Next, I have an academic paper that explores the intersection of positionality and user-centered design. It provides case studies that illustrate how different designers have navigated their positionality in practice. This could give you some concrete examples to draw from in your proposal.\n\n**Emily:** I\u2019d love to see that! I think examples would really help me understand how to apply these concepts.\n\n**Dr. Smith:** Great! I also found an online workshop recording focused on reflexivity in research. It emphasizes the importance of being aware of your biases and how they can affect your research outcomes. Reflexivity is a key component of ethical research, especially in design.\n\n**Emily:** I\u2019ve heard about reflexivity but haven\u2019t explored it much. I think that could really enhance my proposal.\n\n**Dr. Smith:** Definitely. Lastly, I have this comprehensive textbook that outlines various methodologies in design research. It highlights the significance of the researcher\u2019s positionality in shaping outcomes. It\u2019s a bit dense, but it\u2019s a valuable resource for understanding different approaches you might consider for your proposal.\n\n**Emily:** Wow, that\u2019s a lot of great material! How do you suggest I start integrating these ideas into my proposal?\n\n**Dr. Smith:** I recommend starting by reflecting on your own positionality. Consider how your background, experiences, and values influence your design perspective. Then, as you outline your proposal, think about how you can incorporate insights from these resources. For instance, you might want to include a section on ethical considerations and reflexivity, drawing from the video series and workshop.\n\n**Emily:** That makes sense. I\u2019ll start with my reflection and then weave in the resources. Thank you so much for your guidance, Dr. Smith!\n\n**Dr. Smith:** You\u2019re welcome, Emily! I\u2019m looking forward to seeing how your proposal develops. Remember, it\u2019s a process, so take your time to explore these resources and let your ideas evolve. If you have any questions, don\u2019t hesitate to reach out.\n\n**Emily:** I will! Thanks again for your help.\n\n*The tutorial concludes with Emily feeling more confident and equipped to tackle her practice-based proposal, thanks to the resources and guidance provided by Dr. Smith.*"
