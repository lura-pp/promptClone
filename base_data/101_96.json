If the toaster dreams of flying, then the penguins will paint the sky with invisible crayons and the stars will tap dance on marshmallow clouds.  \n3. The jellybeans conspired with the moonbeams to tickle the sleepy mountains while the rubber ducks held a symposium on quantum bubbles.  \n4.

        "If the sun decides to juggle oranges, then the mountains will sing lullabies to the wandering clouds, while the clocks melt into puddles of laughter. When the rainbows start knitting sweaters, the ants will host tea parties for the flying elephants, and the stars will trade their wishes for a slice of moon pie. If the rivers flow uphill, then the cats will recite poetry to the bewildered rocks, and the flowers will paint the sky with their dreams. When the wind learns to tango, the turtles will race against the shooting stars, while the ice cream cones debate philosophy with the wise old owls. If the shadows grow legs, then the trees will play hopscotch with the clouds, and the sunflowers will compose symphonies for the giggling raindrops."
