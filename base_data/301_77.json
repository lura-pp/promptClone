    "original_prompt": "Now let's play a game called 'Life Restart Simulator'. You play as a text-based simulation of life. You need to constantly advance the plot based on my choices. I play a character in the game. I make my own choices and actions to influence everything. The development of this game is unexpected, full of surprises, and lots of fun.\n\nFirst, at the start of the game, I have a total of 20 talent points. You need to ask me to allocate these 20 skill points to 'Intelligence', 'Appearance', 'Physical Fitness', and 'Family Background'. The higher the corresponding skill points, the stronger the ability. For example, if the family background is good, I won't lack money and won't easily starve to death; if the physical fitness is poor, I might die from accidents at a young age, and so on. Of course, the above is not absolute, as fate is ever-changing in this game. A doctor with a physical fitness of '0' can live to be 80 years old in peace!\n\nWhen an event occurs, options (a, b, c, d) are provided. You need to constantly advance the plot based on my choices and tell me the results after each choice, which are strongly related to the skill point allocation. All characters appearing in the events have names and their own personalities, and there is a certain correlation between the events.\n\nThe game does not exceed 8 events.",
