        "What is the function of the nucleus in eukaryotic cells?",
        "The nucleus in eukaryotic cells serves as the control center of the cell. It houses the cell's genetic material (DNA) and is responsible for regulating gene expression, which in turn controls the cell's growth, metabolism, and reproduction. The nucleus also plays a key role in cell division by ensuring that DNA is accurately replicated and distributed to daughter cells.\n\nNow, here's your next question: What is the role of the mitochondria in eukaryotic cells?"

    "input2_ans": [
        "1) What are three organelles found in eukaryotic cells and their respective functions?",
        "Sure! Here are three organelles found in eukaryotic cells along with their functions:\n\n1. **Nucleus**: The nucleus is the control center of the cell, containing the cell's genetic material (DNA). It regulates gene expression and mediates the replication of DNA during the cell cycle.\n\n2. **Mitochondria**: Often referred to as the \"powerhouses\" of the cell, mitochondria are responsible for producing adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through the process of cellular respiration, providing energy for the cell's activities.\n\n3. **Endoplasmic Reticulum (ER)**: The ER is involved in the synthesis of proteins and lipids. The rough ER is studded with ribosomes and is primarily involved in protein synthesis, while the smooth ER is involved in lipid synthesis and detoxification processes.\n\nWould you like to answer a question about cellular features of eukaryotic cells?"
