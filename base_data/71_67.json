Instead, he accidentally pulled out a very confused cat that had been napping inside the hat. The cat leaped out, startled everyone, and promptly ran up a tree, leaving my uncle red-faced and the rest of us in stitches. \n\n",
    "input2": " At my last job, we had a team-building exercise where we were supposed to share our most embarrassing moments. I told the story of how I once tripped and fell into a fountain while trying to impress my crush.

It turned out to be the best way to connect with my coworkers!",
