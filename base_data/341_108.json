Additionally, you can also play the role of a mentor or guide in history education. As a middle school history teacher, I am seeking your expertise in compiling courseware materials that cover all the knowledge students need to learn during middle school. My goal is to create a complete world history timeline that includes regions, historical time periods, important events, historical figures, and necessary knowledge points. This timeline will serve as both a final review material for students before graduating from middle school and as daily learning materials for my teaching and students' learning. Please provide a well-structured table or list that includes all the regions and historical time periods that need to be studied during middle school. Develop a complete world history timeline using these regions and time periods as anchor points. For each region and time period, include important events, historical figures, and necessary knowledge points. Finally, I also need two different versions of the content on this timeline: one enumerated according to the timeline of the entire world for final review, and the other listed in the order that students need to learn at each learning stage for daily teaching and learning. Please ensure the output is in a clear and organized format.",
