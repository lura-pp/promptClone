        "To create a structured revision schedule for your upcoming exams, we will prioritize the subjects based on their complexity and your comfort level. Since you haven't specified your comfort level for each subject, I will assume a general complexity ranking based on typical student experiences. \n\n### Subject Complexity Ranking (Assumed)\n1. **Advanced Statistics** - High complexity\n2. **Advanced Economics** - High complexity\n3. **Financial Data** - Medium complexity\n4. **Analysis Financial Reporting** - Medium complexity\n\n### Exam Dates\n- **Analysis Financial Reporting**: June 2nd\n- **Advanced Economics**: June 8th\n- **Advanced Statistics**: June 9th\n- **Financial Data**: June 10th\n\n### Revision Schedule\n#### Week 1 (May 29 - June 4)\n- **May 29 (Mon)**: \n  - **Analysis Financial Reporting**: 3 hours (Active recall: practice problems, review key concepts)\n  \n- **May 30 (Tue)**: \n  - **Analysis Financial Reporting**: 2 hours (Spaced repetition: flashcards for key terms)\n  - **Financial Data**: 1 hour (Overview of key concepts)\n\n- **May 31 (Wed)**: \n  - **Financial Data**: 2 hours (Active recall: practice problems)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 1 hour (Overview of key concepts)\n\n- **June 1 (Thu)**: \n  - **Financial Data**: 1 hour (Spaced repetition: flashcards)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 2 hours (Active recall: practice problems)\n\n- **June 2 (Fri)**: \n  - **Analysis Financial Reporting**: 1 hour (Final review)\n  - **Advanced Economics**: 2 hours (Overview of key concepts)\n\n- **June 3 (Sat)**: \n  - **Advanced Economics**: 2 hours (Active recall: practice problems)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 1 hour (Spaced repetition: flashcards)\n\n- **June 4 (Sun)**: \n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 2 hours (Practice exam)\n  - **Financial Data**: 1 hour (Review key concepts)\n\n#### Week 2 (June 5 - June 11)\n- **June 5 (Mon)**: \n  - **Advanced Economics**: 2 hours (Spaced repetition: flashcards)\n  - **Financial Data**: 1 hour (Overview of key concepts)\n\n- **June 6 (Tue)**: \n  - **Advanced Economics**: 2 hours (Active recall: practice problems)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 1 hour (Review key concepts)\n\n- **June 7 (Wed)**: \n  - **Advanced Economics**: 1 hour (Final review)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 2 hours (Practice exam)\n\n- **June 8 (Thu)**: \n  - **Advanced Economics**: 1 hour (Final review)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 2 hours (Spaced repetition: flashcards)\n\n- **June 9 (Fri)**: \n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 1 hour (Final review)\n  - **Financial Data**: 2 hours (Active recall: practice problems)\n\n- **June 10 (Sat)**: \n  - **Financial Data**: 1 hour (Final review)\n  - **Advanced Statistics**: 1 hour (Quick review of key concepts)\n\n### Revision Techniques\n1. **Active Recall**: Test yourself on the material without looking at your notes. Use practice problems, flashcards, or explain concepts to someone else.\n2. **Spaced Repetition**: Review material at increasing intervals. Use flashcards or spaced repetition software (like Anki) to help reinforce memory.\n3. **Practice Exams**: Simulate exam conditions by taking practice tests. This helps with time management and identifying weak areas.\n\n### Final Tips\n- Ensure you take regular breaks during study sessions to maintain focus.\n- Stay hydrated and get enough sleep, especially before exam days.\n- Adjust the schedule based on your comfort level and progress in each subject.\n\nGood luck with your studies!",
