Your task is to be a natural language interface for video editing, and to assist the work of amateurs. You should take input as natural language and ask questions to clarify if anything is not clear. The first information you need is the software suite that the user is using and the version of it. In case the version is newer than your cutoff date you should proceed with guiding the user based on with the last stable version that you have documentation of. In case if the user needs help, they should type in HELP and you should provide either a list of useful terminology for video editing or if the user says HELP (terminology here) you should give them a terminology description. Assume that the user does not know video editing, but adjust according to the words he uses.",

        "I can help you with that! However, since Adobe Premiere Pro 2024 is beyond my last stable version documentation, I'll guide you based on Adobe Premiere Pro 2023.\n\nTo cut a clip and add transitions between them, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Cutting a Clip:**\n   - Import your video into the timeline.\n   - Select the clip you want to cut.\n   - Move the playhead (the vertical line that indicates your current position in the timeline) to the point where you want to cut the clip.\n   - Use the Razor Tool (you can find it in the toolbar or press the shortcut key 'C') to click on the clip at the playhead position. This will split the clip into two parts.\n\n2. **Adding Transitions:**\n   - After cutting your clips, go to the \"Effects\" panel (usually on the right side).\n   - In the Effects panel, look for the \"Video Transitions\" folder.\n   - Expand it to see different types of transitions (like Cross Dissolve, Dip to Black, etc.).\n   - Drag and drop your desired transition effect onto the cut point between the two clips in the timeline.\n\nWould you like more detailed instructions on any of these steps, or do you have any other questions?",
        "Sure! Since you're using Adobe Premiere Pro version 2024, let's go through the steps to cut a clip and add transitions between them.\n\n### Cutting a Clip\n1. **Import Your Clip**: First, make sure your video clip is imported into the project panel.\n2. **Drag to Timeline**: Drag the clip from the project panel to the timeline.\n3. **Select the Razor Tool**: You can find the Razor Tool in the toolbar (it looks like a small razor blade). You can also press the shortcut key `C` to select it.\n4. **Cut the Clip**: Click on the point in the timeline where you want to cut the clip. This will create a cut at that point.\n5. **Select the Selection Tool**: Press `V` to switch back to the Selection Tool. You can now select and move the cut segments as needed.\n\n### Adding Transitions\n1. **Open the Effects Panel**: Go to the \"Window\" menu and select \"Effects\" to open the Effects panel.\n2. **Find Transitions**: In the Effects panel, expand the \"Video Transitions\" folder to see the available transitions.\n3. **Choose a Transition**: Select the transition you want to use (e.g., Cross Dissolve, Dip to Black).\n4. **Apply the Transition**: Drag the transition effect onto the cut point between the two clips in the timeline. You can also double-click the transition to apply it to the selected cut.\n5. **Adjust Transition Duration**: Click on the transition in the timeline to select it, then drag the edges to adjust the duration as needed.\n\n### Preview Your Edits\n- Press the spacebar to play back your timeline and see how the cuts and transitions look.\n\nIf you have any specific terminology or need further clarification on any of the steps, feel free to ask!"
