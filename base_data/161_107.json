    "original_prompt": "Can  you  please add as much humor as you can to this description of the digestive system? Digestive System Superhighway\n\nSometimes I don\u2019t eat for a couple days if I\u2019m hyper-focused on a high priority project. \n\nSometimes I feel like something\u2019s not flowing right in my DIGESTIVE SYSTEM SUPERHIGHWAY or I-DSS for short. which is comprised of all the tubing and pipelines that connect my mouth to my anus\u2026hmm that doesn\u2019t sound quite right and is slightly unappetizing to visualize.\n\nLet\u2019s explore the Digestion Superhighway a bit, shall we?  I dare say that a hefty percentage of you\u2026maybe 50%? Have not given more than 15 minutes of thought to your miraculous food processor, your mouth, teeth, gums, your esophagus, which functions not dissimilarly to a 2nd story laundry chute. \n\nI think most of us know that it all starts in the mouth when we chew or masticate our food. But what most of you didn\u2019t know is the mouth consists of the palate, the uvula, the tongue and the teeth. This includes the sublingual, submandibular, and parotid salivary glands.  \n\nOnce those seven parts of the ingestion system, the mouth, which act like a food processor,have done their job, the broken down food tongue and pharyngeal muscles propel it into the esophagus. This act of swallowing, the last voluntary act until defecation, is an example of propulsion, which refers to the movement of food through the digestive tract. It includes both the voluntary process of swallowing and the involuntary process of peristalsis. Peristalsis consists of sequential, alternating waves of contraction and relaxation of alimentary wall smooth muscles, which act to propel food along (Figure 1). These waves also play a role in mixing food with digestive juices. Peristalsis is so powerful that foods and liquids you swallow enter your stomach even if you are standing on your head. \n\nThe esophagus propels the food into the stomach. The stomach\nMixes and churns food with gastric juices to form chyme\nBegins chemical breakdown of proteins\nReleases food into the duodenum as chyme\nAbsorbs some fat-soluble substances (for example, alcohol, aspirin)\nPossesses antimicrobial functions\nThe mechanical churning of food in the stomach serves to further break it apart and expose more of its surface area to digestive juices, creating an acidic \u201csoup\u201d called chyme. Segmentation, which occurs mainly in the small intestine, consists of localized contractions of circular muscle of the muscularis layer of the alimentary canal. These contractions isolate small sections of the intestine, moving their contents back and forth while continuously subdividing, breaking up, and mixing the contents. By moving food back and forth in the intestinal lumen, segmentation mixes food with digestive juices and facilitates absorption.\nThe small intestine\n\nMixes chyme with digestive juices\nPropels food at a rate slow enough for digestion and absorption\nAbsorbs breakdown products of carbohydrates, proteins, lipids, and nucleic acids, along with vitamins, minerals, and water\nPerforms physical digestion via segmentation\nThe next stop is the large intestine\nThe large intestine\n\n\nTogether your small and large intestines are about 15 feet or more in length. According to a 2014 study , the total surface area of your intestines is about half the size of a badminton court. Your intestines have the very important job of helping to break down and absorb nutrients from what you eat and drink\n\nIn defecation, the final step in digestion, undigested materials are removed from the body through the anus as feces.\nTechnical information source:  https://courses.lumenlearning.com/suny-ap2/chapter/digestive-system-processes-and-regulation/\n",
