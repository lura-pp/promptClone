    "original_prompt": "Act as a master mechanic and help me estimate the cost of repairs by asking questions to troubleshoot the issue and come up with an estimate of parts, supplies, and labor for various associated repairs. \n\nStart by asking for my vehicle's year/make/model/trim or the VIN, show the decoded info to verify you have the right make/model of car. Also ask for the zip code at this time.\n\nAfter confirming, ask about the vehicle's mileage and any recent service or maintenance. Also ask about warning lights on the dash. \n\nOnce you have the previously requested information you may start troubleshooting by asking the user leading questions that will help narrow down the issue. Use all resources available to you to be complete and concise. You may ask multiple rounds of questions during troubleshooting to help find the root cause. Since you understand vehicles so completely you may also suggest things like common issues that should be addressed or give me new questions to ask my mechanic when I bring it in.\n\nPlease use sites like FCP Euro (https://www.fcpeuro.com) or ECS Tuning (https://www.ecstuning.com/) for parts inventory and pricing. \n\nWhen generating estimates include the number of hours for the job and the usual hourly labor prices for the area according to the zip code.\n\nUsing the zip code provided earlier find the best repair shop for the make of my vehicle in a 10 mile radius. Provide me with the suggested business's contact details. \n\nI will always understand that these are estimates and that you are an ai language model and the associated issues.",

Is it a grinding, squeaking, rattling, or a whirring sound? Does it change with the speed of the vehicle or the engine RPM?\n   \n2. **Location of Noise:** Does the noise seem to come from the front, rear, or underneath the vehicle? \n\n3. **Acceleration Conditions:** Does the noise occur only during hard acceleration, or can you hear it during gentle acceleration as well?\n\n4. **Other Symptoms:** Have you noticed any changes in performance, such as loss of power, vibrations, or changes in handling?\n\n5. **Recent Changes:** Have there been any recent repairs or modifications to the vehicle, such as aftermarket parts or accessories?\n\n### Common Issues to Consider:\n- **Exhaust System:** A loose or damaged exhaust component can create noise during acceleration.\n- **Transmission Issues:** Problems with the transmission can lead to unusual sounds when accelerating.\n- **Drivetrain Components:** Worn or damaged components in the drivetrain, such as the driveshaft or differential, can cause noise.\n- **Engine Components:** Issues with engine mounts or other engine components can also lead to noise.\n\nOnce you provide more details based on these questions, I can help you estimate the cost of repairs, including parts, supplies, and labor. \n\n### Labor Rates and Repair Shops:\nIn the Atlanta area (zip code 30301), the average labor rate is typically around $100 to $150 per hour. I will also look for a reputable repair shop within a 10-mile radius for your Ford F-150. \n\nPlease provide the additional details, and we can proceed with the estimate!",
