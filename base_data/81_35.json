I stumbled upon a hidden village where the inhabitants were celebrating a festival, but they seemed to be wary of me.

        "Hi Sarah! What a fascinating dream you had! Flying over a vast ocean is such a powerful image, and the giant wave adds a dramatic twist. Let's dive into it!\n\nFirst off, flying often symbolizes freedom, liberation, or a desire to rise above challenges. It can represent your aspirations or a sense of control over your life. The ocean, on the other hand, is a deep and complex symbol. It can represent the unconscious mind, emotions, or the vastness of possibilities. \n\nNow, the giant wave chasing you is intriguing! Waves can symbolize overwhelming emotions or challenges that feel like they\u2019re about to crash down on you. The fact that it felt alive and you could hear it roaring suggests that these emotions or challenges are not just external but also deeply personal. \n\nYou mentioned feeling exhilarated and terrified at the same time. This duality could indicate that you are navigating a situation in your waking life that brings both excitement and fear. Perhaps there\u2019s something you\u2019re pursuing that feels both liberating and daunting? \n\nWhat\u2019s going on in your life right now that might relate to these feelings? Are there any big changes or decisions on the horizon? And how do you usually cope with feelings of being overwhelmed? \n\nLet\u2019s explore this together!",
        "Hi Sarah! Thanks for sharing your dream with me. Flying over a vast ocean is such a powerful image, and being chased by a giant wave adds a thrilling twist! Let's dive into it together.\n\nFlying often symbolizes freedom, liberation, or a desire to rise above challenges. The vast ocean can represent the depths of your emotions or the unconscious mind. It\u2019s a space of both beauty and potential danger, much like our feelings can be.\n\nNow, the giant wave chasing you is particularly intriguing. Waves can symbolize overwhelming emotions or situations that feel out of control. The fact that it felt alive and you could hear it roaring suggests that these emotions or challenges are not just passive; they are active and demanding your attention.\n\nFeeling exhilarated and terrified at the same time might indicate that you\u2019re navigating a situation in your waking life that brings both excitement and fear. It could be a new opportunity, a change, or even a personal challenge that feels both liberating and daunting.\n\nWhat do you think? Does this resonate with any current experiences or feelings in your life?"

        "Hey Alex! Thanks for sharing your dream with me\u2014what a fascinating journey you had! Wandering through a dense forest often symbolizes a journey into the unconscious or exploring the unknown parts of yourself. The glowing plants could represent insights or ideas that are illuminating your path, but they also suggest that there\u2019s something magical or transformative happening in your life.\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about that hidden village. Festivals are usually about community, celebration, and connection, but the fact that the inhabitants were wary of you adds an interesting twist. It might reflect feelings of being an outsider in your waking life or perhaps a fear of not being accepted in certain social situations. \n\nYou mentioned feeling a strong connection to the place despite the isolation. This duality is intriguing! It could indicate that you\u2019re grappling with a desire for belonging while also feeling like you\u2019re on a unique path that sets you apart. \n\nWhat do you think the glowing plants represent for you? Are there any new ideas or changes in your life that feel both exciting and a bit daunting? And how do you feel about the idea of community versus individuality in your life right now? Let\u2019s dig a little deeper!",
        "Hi Alex! Thanks for sharing your dream with me. It sounds like a fascinating experience! Let's dive into it together.\n\nWandering through a dense forest often symbolizes a journey into the unknown or exploring your subconscious. The glowing plants could represent insights or ideas that are illuminating your path, perhaps suggesting that there are aspects of yourself or your life that are becoming clearer to you.\n\nThe hidden village and the festival might symbolize a part of your life or identity that feels vibrant and alive, yet also somewhat distant or inaccessible. The inhabitants' wariness could reflect feelings of being an outsider or not fully belonging in certain social situations. This sense of connection you felt, paired with isolation, might indicate a longing for community or understanding, but also a fear of vulnerability or rejection.\n\nWhat do you think about these interpretations? Do any specific feelings or thoughts come to mind when you reflect on the dream?"
