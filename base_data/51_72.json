    "original_prompt": "Hey chatgpt, turn this review into a complain email that can let them fire that staff member.\nThe staff member is super passive-aggressive and impolite. I was having a business meeting and move to one of the quite rooms without knowing that I need to pay again. And she came into the room and interrupted me and force me to leave 3 times even though I requested to pay after I finished. When I came out, she started to say in a really really condescending way that I shouldn't ignore her and how that room cost $95/hour and I may not be able to afford it. I never felt being insulted like this and I will never come back again.",

During a crucial business meeting, I moved to one of the quieter rooms, unaware that an additional payment was required.

When I finally exited, she confronted me in an extremely condescending manner, implying that I was ignoring her and questioning my financial ability to afford the room's rate of $95/hour. This encounter left me feeling deeply insulted and disrespected. I believe such behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in your establishment.\n\n",
