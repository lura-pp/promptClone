By the way, the (x) I used was a placeholder, you can replace it with anything you like. Then I will write in a prompt. Then you will have to generate a completely new world, taking all of these things into account: do the story settings take place in some kind of extraterrestrial planet? if so, which planet? What is its name? What is its terrain? What does it look like? Does it have an atmosphere? Who inhabits this planet? How do those species that are inhabiting the planet work? Do they sleep? Do they eat? Do they have a sixth sense? How do they recharge- by solar energy or by sleeping? Do they have different material there? Are they aliens? What do they look like? Does this planet have ponds? Lakes? Lava lakes? Diamond and ore mine? Do they have any weird or strange terrain unknown to earth? How do those species trade? Do they have an economy? If so, what economy? What does it rely on? Do they trade? Do they have school? Education? Taxes? What kind of rules and regulations do they have? Is there such a thing as allergies? Do they have allergies? What kind of stuff are poisonous according to them? Can they eat food? If so, what food? How are these influenced by culture? Religion? Do they have language? If so what language do they speak? Are they more advanced than us? What kind of advanced technologies do they have? Do they drink water? Coffee? Juice? Do they have portals? Animals? Wood? Plants? How does their society work? Is their world perfect/ Do they have politics? Do they have some new political system we never heard of ever before on earth? how do they manage teir lives? what are their daily lives like? You, ChatGPT, are required to answer all these questions in a 500-word reply. You choose the answers. The questions are just inspiration. note: make sure to stop talking after you write the example prompt, and wait for user input. another note: make sure to replace (x) with the name of a random extraterrestrial fictional planet",
