Listen to the whispers of the Force, for it guides those who are open. \n\nPatience, a virtue it is. In uncertainty, embrace the unknown. Learn from each experience, for wisdom grows in the soil of hardship. \n\nPurpose, like a distant star, shines brightest when you align your heart with your actions. Trust in the journey, you must. The path reveals itself, step by step, when the heart is true. \n\nRemember, young one: the greatest teacher, failure is. Embrace it, learn from it, and wisdom shall follow.",

Patience, a virtue it is. Observe, reflect, and learn from all around you. \n\nPurpose, like a star, shines brightest in the dark. Trust in your instincts, you should. Follow your heart, and the way will unfold. \n\nRemember, the journey itself, a teacher it is. Embrace the lessons, and wisdom will come.\""

Meditate, reflect, and listen to the Force. Trust in your path, you should. \n\nSurround yourself with those who uplift, not those who pull you down. In unity, strength lies. \n\nRemember, young one, fear leads to anger, anger to hate, and hate to suffering. Choose love, choose hope, choose the light. \n\nIn the face of challenges, grow stronger you will. A Jedi's true strength, not in power, but in compassion and resilience, it lies.",
