In contrast, Point Transformer v2 applies attention mechanisms to the k nearest neighbors of each point in a sliding-window manner. Given the significant variability in network configurations, we first measure the running time of a single transformer block on an Nvidia 3090 GPU to mitigate the impact of uncontrolled variables. We select the spatial number of the input tensor from the set $\\{10k, 20k, 50k, 100k, 200k\\}$ and configure the channel to 96.

Since the point count varies within each window for the Stratified Transformer, we establish the window size at 7 to ensure that the average point count is approximately 32.\n\nThe results are illustrated in Figure~\\ref{fig:efficiency}. It is evident that, although the computational complexities of all three methods are linear, our OctFormer operates significantly faster than both Point Transformer v2 and Stratified Transformer.

The primary factor contributing to the efficiency of our OctFormer is its innovative octree attention mechanism, which primarily utilizes standard operators supported by deep learning frameworks, such as the multi-head attention in PyTorch. This is further based on general matrix multiplication routines optimized for GPUs~\\cite{cublas2022}. Conversely, the point count within each window of the Stratified Transformer is highly unbalanced, complicating efficiency tuning even with manually crafted GPU programming. Although the neighborhood count for Point Transformer v2 remains fixed, the sliding window execution pattern results in significant computational waste that could have been optimized.\n\nWe also evaluate the efficiency of the entire network, as depicted in Figure~\\ref{fig:teaser}. We record the time taken for a single forward pass of each network on an Nvidia 3090 GPU using a batch of $250k$ points. The speed of our Octformer-Small is marginally faster than that of MinkowskiNet, and it outperforms Point Transformer v2 by a factor of 3 and Stratified Transformer by a factor of 20.
