        "1. **What is it?**  \n   Quantum Mechanics is a fundamental theory in physics that describes the behavior of matter and energy at the atomic and subatomic levels. It introduces concepts such as wave-particle duality, where particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, and the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties, like position and momentum, cannot be simultaneously measured with arbitrary precision.\n\n2. **How it has evolved over time?**  \n   Quantum Mechanics evolved in the early 20th century as scientists sought to explain phenomena that classical mechanics could not, such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect. Key figures like Max Planck, Albert Einstein, Niels Bohr, and later, Werner Heisenberg and Erwin Schr\u00f6dinger, contributed to its development. The theory has undergone significant refinement, leading to the formulation of quantum field theory and the Standard Model of particle physics.\n\n3. **How its scientific understanding has built upon past knowledge?**  \n   Quantum Mechanics built upon classical physics, electromagnetism, and thermodynamics by addressing their limitations at microscopic scales. For instance, classical theories could not explain the discrete energy levels of electrons in atoms or the behavior of light as both a wave and a particle. The incorporation of Planck's quantization of energy and Einstein's work on photons laid the groundwork for a new understanding of physical phenomena.\n\n4. **Are there new evidences? Or new assumptions?**  \n   Recent advancements in quantum mechanics include the discovery of quantum entanglement, which challenges classical intuitions about locality and causality. Additionally, the development of quantum computing has opened new avenues for practical applications of quantum principles. Experiments such as those involving Bell's theorem have provided strong evidence for the non-locality of quantum mechanics, leading to new assumptions about the nature of reality.\n\n5. **What theories have been revised or abandoned?**  \n   Classical physics, particularly Newtonian mechanics, has been revised in light of quantum mechanics, as it cannot adequately describe phenomena at the quantum level. The concept of determinism in classical physics has been challenged by the probabilistic nature of quantum mechanics. Additionally, theories such as the classical wave theory of light have been replaced by quantum electrodynamics, which incorporates both wave and particle aspects.\n\n6. **How methods of investigation have improved?**  \n   Methods of investigation in quantum mechanics have significantly improved with advancements in technology. Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, allow scientists to probe the fundamental constituents of matter at unprecedented energies. Advanced imaging techniques, like scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum state tomography, enable researchers to observe and manipulate quantum systems with high precision, leading to deeper insights into quantum phenomena.",

It introduces concepts such as wave-particle duality, where particles like electrons exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties, and the uncertainty principle, which states that certain pairs of physical properties cannot be simultaneously known to arbitrary precision.\n\n**How it has evolved over time?**  \nQuantum mechanics has evolved significantly since its inception in the early 20th century. Initially developed to address phenomena that classical mechanics could not explain, such as blackbody radiation and the photoelectric effect, it has grown to encompass a wide range of phenomena. Over time, it has integrated various principles and concepts, leading to a more comprehensive understanding of atomic structure, chemical bonding, and the behavior of particles at high energies.\n\n**How its scientific understanding has built upon past knowledge?**  \nThe scientific understanding of quantum mechanics has built upon earlier theories, particularly electromagnetism and thermodynamics. For instance, Max Planck's work on quantization of energy laid the groundwork for quantum theory, while Albert Einstein's explanation of the photoelectric effect demonstrated the particle nature of light. These foundational theories provided the necessary context for the development of quantum mechanics, allowing scientists to build a more complete picture of atomic and subatomic processes.\n\n**Are there new evidences? Or new assumptions?**  \nRecent advancements in quantum mechanics have introduced new evidence and applications, particularly in the fields of quantum entanglement and quantum computing. Experiments have confirmed the existence of entangled particles, which can instantaneously affect each other's states regardless of distance, challenging classical notions of locality. Additionally, the development of quantum computing has opened new avenues for processing information, leveraging quantum bits (qubits) to perform calculations that are infeasible for classical computers.\n\n**What theories have been revised or abandoned?**  \nAs quantum mechanics has advanced, several classical theories have been revised or abandoned. Classical physics, which includes Newtonian mechanics and Maxwell's equations, cannot fully explain phenomena at the quantum level. For example, the deterministic nature of classical mechanics is replaced by probabilistic interpretations in quantum mechanics. The failure of classical theories to account for quantum phenomena has led to a paradigm shift in our understanding of the physical universe.\n\n**How methods of investigation have improved?**  \nMethods of investigation in quantum mechanics have significantly improved with the advent of advanced technologies. Particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, allow scientists to probe the fundamental components of matter at unprecedented energies. Additionally, advanced imaging techniques, like scanning tunneling microscopy and quantum state tomography, enable researchers to observe and manipulate quantum systems with high precision. These advancements have facilitated deeper insights into quantum phenomena and have driven the development of new technologies based on quantum principles."

        "1. **What is it?**  \n   Evolutionary biology is the scientific study of the processes that have led to the diversity of life on Earth. It encompasses the mechanisms of evolution, such as natural selection, genetic drift, mutation, and gene flow, and examines how these processes contribute to the adaptation and speciation of organisms over time.\n\n2. **How it has evolved over time?**  \n   The field of evolutionary biology has evolved significantly since its inception. Early ideas were primarily influenced by Charles Darwin's theory of natural selection, presented in \"On the Origin of Species\" in 1859. Over time, the integration of Mendelian genetics in the early 20th century led to the development of the Modern Synthesis, which combined Darwinian evolution with genetic principles. In recent decades, the field has expanded further with the incorporation of molecular biology, genomics, and evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).\n\n3. **How its scientific understanding has built upon past knowledge?**  \n   The understanding of evolution has built upon knowledge from various fields, including paleontology, which provides fossil evidence of past life forms; comparative anatomy, which reveals homologous structures among different species; and biogeography, which studies the distribution of species. The synthesis of these disciplines has enriched the understanding of evolutionary processes and the relationships among organisms.\n\n4. **Are there new evidences? Or new assumptions?**  \n   Yes, there is ongoing research that provides new evidence supporting and refining evolutionary theory. Advances in genetic studies, such as whole-genome sequencing, have revealed the genetic basis of traits and adaptations, allowing scientists to trace evolutionary lineages with greater precision. New fossil discoveries continue to fill gaps in the evolutionary timeline, providing insights into transitional forms and the history of life on Earth.\n\n5. **What theories have been revised or abandoned?**  \n   Some theories, such as Lamarckism, which proposed that organisms could pass on traits acquired during their lifetime to their offspring, have been largely abandoned in favor of Darwinian evolution and the principles of genetics. While Lamarckian ideas have been revisited in some contexts (e.g., epigenetics), they do not hold the same explanatory power as modern evolutionary theory.\n\n6. **How methods of investigation have improved?**  \n   Methods of investigation in evolutionary biology have improved dramatically with technological advancements. The advent of DNA sequencing technologies has revolutionized the field, allowing for the analysis of genetic material from a wide range of organisms. Bioinformatics tools enable researchers to analyze large datasets, model evolutionary relationships, and conduct phylogenetic studies with greater accuracy.
