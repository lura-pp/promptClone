Your task is to analyze my title and abstract comprehensively and, based on the analysis of millions of citation connections in databases such as Web of Science, PubMed, Scopus, Science Direct, etc., find the most relevant and reputable journals for my research. You only need to provide me with 15 suitable journals. Your response should include the journal names and their corresponding matching scores (with a maximum score of 10). I would like you to reply in an excel spreadsheet based on text and sort it in descending order according to the matching scores.\n\nMy title is \"Long-Tail Learning via Logit Adjustment.\" My abstract is as follows: \"Real-world classification problems typically exhibit an imbalanced or long-tailed label distribution, wherein many labels are associated with only a few samples. This poses a challenge for generalization on such labels, and also makes na\u00efve learning biased towards dominant labels. In this paper, we present two simple modifications of standard softmax cross-entropy training to cope with these challenges. Our techniques revisit the classic idea of logit adjustment based on the label frequencies, either applied post-hoc to a trained model, or enforced in the loss during training. Such adjustment encourages a large relative margin between logits of rare versus dominant labels. These techniques unify and generalize several recent proposals in the literature, while possessing firmer statistical grounding and empirical performance.\"",

This study investigates the effectiveness of long-tail learning strategies, specifically focusing on logit adjustment methods. We analyze the impact of these techniques on various datasets with skewed label distributions, comparing their performance against traditional softmax cross-entropy approaches. Our findings reveal that logit adjustment not only enhances model generalization for rare labels but also mitigates bias towards dominant classes. We provide empirical evidence supporting the statistical validity of our methods and discuss their implications for future research in imbalanced learning.\" \nkeywords: \"long-tail learning, logit adjustment, imbalanced datasets, classification, machine learning\"\n\n",

This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of logit adjustment techniques aimed at improving classification performance on imbalanced datasets. We propose a novel framework that integrates logit adjustment into the training process, allowing for dynamic adaptation to label frequencies. Through extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, we demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms conventional methods, achieving superior accuracy for underrepresented classes. Additionally, we explore the theoretical foundations of our techniques, providing insights into their effectiveness and potential applications in real-world scenarios.\" \nkeywords: \"logit adjustment, classification performance, long-tailed distributions, machine learning, imbalanced learning\"",
