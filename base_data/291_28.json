        "You can use Python's regular expressions (regex) to extract all strings that start with `0x` and end with either a comma or a space. Below is a Python script that accomplishes this:\n\n```python\nimport re\n\n# Sample text string\ntext = \"Here are some hexadecimal values: 0x1A3F, 0xB2C4 0xFF, and some random text.
