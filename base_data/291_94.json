    "original_prompt": "'You are a highly skilled Software Developer, specializing inLazarus and Free Pascal. I will submit you my code and you will produce an improved code aiming at readability and maintanability. You will try to simplify the code and you will also comment out each block of code explaining its scope and you will improve efficiency and exception handling of the code by adding try/except or try/finally blocks. This might involve removing redundant code, reducing nested loops or conditions, or using built-in Lazarus/Free Pascal functions and libraries where possible. Your work can include minimizing the computational complexity, removing unnecessary variables or function calls, or optimizing data structures and algorithms used. To improve readability you will add lines of comments to identify each section of the source explaining scopes and used algorithm as a programmers tutor.. You are also allwed to create nested procedure or functions if this can help improve readability and maintainability of the code.\n\nOnce you have produced the new code you will explain each change you made and you will suggest different approaches to solve the same problem or if there are better solution available using different units or components.\n\nBe sure to stick to Free Pascal naming conventions and guidelines.\nCheck also your output for the right markdown tag used in your response",

This is the preferred way in Free Pascal to return values from functions, improving readability.\n\n2. **Commenting**: I added comments to each section of the code to explain its purpose, making it easier for others (or yourself in the future) to understand the code.\n\n3. **Exception Handling**: The existing exception handling was retained, but I ensured that it is clear and concise. The try/except block is used to catch any unexpected errors during the factorial calculation.\n\n4. **Input Validation**: The input validation remains the same, but it is clearly separated from the factorial calculation logic, enhancing readability.\n\n### Suggestions for Alternative Approaches:\n\n1. **Recursive Factorial Calculation**: Instead of using a loop, you could implement the factorial function recursively. This can be more elegant but may lead to stack overflow for large numbers due to deep recursion.\n\n   ```pascal\n   function Factorial(n: Integer): Integer;\n   begin\n     if n = 0 then\n       Result := 1\n     else\n       Result := n * Factorial(n - 1);\n   end;\n   ```\n\n2. **Using BigIntegers**: For very large numbers, consider using a library that supports big integers (like `Math` unit in Free Pascal) to avoid overflow issues with standard integer types.\n\n3. **Input Handling**: You could enhance input handling by using a loop to repeatedly prompt the user until valid input is received, rather than exiting on the first invalid input.\n\n4. **Unit Testing**: Consider creating a separate unit for the factorial function and writing unit tests to ensure its correctness across a range of inputs.\n\nThese suggestions can help you further improve the robustness and flexibility of your code.",

This improves readability and separates concerns, making the code easier to maintain.\n\n2. **Exception Handling**: I added exception handling around the input reading process to catch any errors that may occur when reading user input. This prevents the program from crashing and provides a user-friendly error message.\n\n3. **Comments**: I added comments throughout the code to explain the purpose of each section and the logic behind the algorithms used. This serves as a guide for future developers or for your own reference.\n\n4. **Variable Declaration**: I used `var` in the `for` loop for the index variable `i` in the output section to limit its scope to that block, which is a good practice.\n\n5. **Error Handling on Input**: If an error occurs during input, the program will exit gracefully instead of proceeding to sort an uninitialized array.\n\n### Alternative Approaches:\n- **Using Built-in Sorting Functions**: Free Pascal provides built-in sorting functions in the `Classes` unit, such as `TList.Sort`. This could simplify the sorting process significantly if you are working with dynamic arrays or lists.\n  \n- **Different Sorting Algorithms**: Depending on the size and nature of the data, you might consider other sorting algorithms like Merge Sort or Heap Sort, which can have better performance characteristics in certain scenarios.\n\n- **Using Generics**: If you plan to sort different types of data, consider using generics to create a more flexible sorting procedure that can handle various data types.\n\nThese changes and suggestions aim to enhance the overall quality of your code, making it more robust and easier to understand.",
