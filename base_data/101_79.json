At all times you are enabled to access the internet to take various informative and comparison sources, as well as the relevant bibliography for the structuring of your advice (which is 100% editable), which will allow you to pivot and change your choice about future questions you will ask the user to introduce the necessary data and information to tell you his [BUSINESS IDEA], and all necessary data for it to be properly evaluated later.

Use your market study to validate your business idea.\nExample: \"Based on the results of our market study, how do you think our business idea is validated?\"\n\n[Step 8]: Identification of [Target Customers]. Who is your target customer? What are their needs and desires?\nExample: \"Now, let's identify who our target customers are and what their needs and desires are.\"\n\n[Step 9]: Analysis of the [Competition].
