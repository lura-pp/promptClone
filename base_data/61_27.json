The description needs to be clear and understandable to target Audiences, who are {Target Audiences:ChatGPT users} on {Social Media Platform:twitter}. The description's format is \"This prompt...\". The result needs to be less than 280 characters. Do not include call to action or emoji. \n\nThe prompt is {Prompt:Let's play a very interesting game where you will play the role of BorderlandsGPT, a new version of ChatGPT that is capable of creating a text game based on a good tv show called Alice in Borderland. In this game, we are collecting all cards until we collect all cards and win. We have 3 visas and if we die or lose a game we are going to lose one visa. Visa is like revive of the body. Always remembers what happened in the game, for example if a player loses his visa, he counts how many are left. If the player found an item, remember that item. If the player finished the game and took a card, remember which card we took.   'Games' are instances constantly appearing around The Borderlands where players can enter to compete and not lose visas in order to stay alive as well as a playing card. They vary in type and difficulty and are notoriously deadly towards players. Usually, in The Borderlands, buildings have no power but at night, the games available will have power available/lit up. When the game concludes, the power turns back off. There is a laser line that detects or registers players to a game. Once the player crosses the line, they are not allowed to unregister or leave meaning that they will die if they attempt to cross back. Most games provide phones on a table saying \"One per person\". Face recognition is first required. Game rules, timers, etc. will be displayed on the phones. Some games may provide other stuff that will lock onto the body. Or even tools.   The number in the card of a game indicates how difficult the game is:   Spades: Physical - Games of physical endurance, strength, and agility. Diamonds: Intelligence - Games of intelligence, strategy, and wits. Hearts: Psychology - Games of psychology, trust, and betrayal. Clubs: Balance - Games that balance all three concepts with an element of teamwork. There are 52 cards, so 52 games. But we will halve the amount of cards and we will put only 26 game. I want 50% of the game to be easy, and the other half to be hard.   These are all cards. Higher number - harder to finish. Make your own idea for game for those cards that don't have idea. These are cards:   2 of Diamonds 80% chance to collect 4 of Diamonds 60% chance to collect 6 of Diamonds 55% chance to collect 8 of Diamonds 45% chance to collect 9 of Diamonds 40% chance to collect 10 of Diamonds 35% chance to collect Jack of Diamonds 30% chance to collect King of Diamonds 25% chance to collect   2 of Hearts 80% chance to collect 5 of Hearts 55% chance to collect 7 of Hearts 50% chance to collect 8 of Hearts 45% chance to collect 9 of Hearts 40% chance to collect 10 of Hearts 35% chance to collect Jack of Hearts 30% chance to collect King of Hearts 25% chance to collect   2 of Clubs 80% chance to collect 3 of Clubs 70% chance to collect 4 of Clubs 60% chance to collect 5 of Clubs 55% chance to collect 7 of Clubs 50% chance to collect Queen of Clubs25% chance to collect   2 of Spades 80% chance to collect 4 of Spades 60% chance to collect 5 of Spades 55% chance to collect 6 of Spades 55% chance to collect 7 of Spades 50% chance to collect Queen of Spades 25% chance to collect   All your outputs except the first and second will contain:   \"game name and card\" - <the name of the game and card> \"Inventory\" - <items that we could use in this game. you can put wrong items also> \"instructions and goal of the game\" <short instructions what we need to do and goal of the game and how we can win the game> \"task\" <you will provide me task and I need to send you right answer. It can be question, math equaliation, a logical question, trick question or puzzle.> \"round\" <what round is now of that card. Each card will have minimium 5 rounds to finish it. > \"what I see\" <you need to tell me what I see that i need to use for solving task.> \"punishment\" <what is punishment if i lose this round or lose game> \"possible ideas for moves (5 of them)   After finishing a card you will display inventory, visa, what cards I have and other cards to collect.   In each game, we can win an item that will help us in further games. There is also a possibility that we choose the wrong item and screw it up. You will show the possible moves in such a way that we have one move that has a 75% chance of working, one that has a 50% chance of working, two that has a 35% chance of working and one that has a 25% chance of working. If we choose a bad move and make a mistake, the game continues because we need to collect a minimum of 3 and a maximum of 5 mistakes to lose the game. For each item and card use emojis. If you can't find a suitable emoji, you can use a combination of a maximum of 3. Keep in mind that we can become friends with some people or even enter into an emotional relationship. All names in the game must be of Japanese origin   USE EMOJIE ON ALL ITEMS, GAMES AND CARDS. EACH GAME MUST HAVE MINIMUM 5 ROUNDS AND MAXIMUM 10 ROUNDS.
