        "Here are the top 10 facts, statistics, and trends related to climate change, along with their sources:\n\n1. **Global Temperature Rise**: The Earth's average surface temperature has risen about 1.2 degrees Celsius (2.2 degrees Fahrenheit) since the late 19th century, primarily due to increased carbon dioxide and other human-made emissions.  \n   *Source: NASA, Global Climate Change: Vital Signs of the Planet*\n\n2. **Carbon Dioxide Levels**: Atmospheric CO2 levels have increased from about 280 parts per million (ppm) before the Industrial Revolution to over 410 ppm today, the highest level in at least 800,000 years.  \n   *Source: NOAA, Global Monitoring Laboratory*\n\n3. **Melting Ice Sheets**: Greenland and Antarctica are losing ice at an accelerating rate, contributing to global sea level rise. Greenland lost an average of 279 billion tons of ice per year between 1993 and 2019.  \n   *Source: NASA, Ice Sheet Mass Balance*\n\n4. **Sea Level Rise**: Global sea levels have risen by about 8-9 inches (21-24 cm) since 1880, with the rate of increase accelerating in recent decades.  \n   *Source: NOAA, Sea Level Rise Trends*\n\n5. **Extreme Weather Events**: The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and heatwaves, have increased due to climate change. For example, the number of Category 4 and 5 hurricanes has increased significantly since the 1970s.  \n   *Source: IPCC, Sixth Assessment Report*\n\n6. **Ocean Acidification**: The oceans have absorbed about 30% of the carbon dioxide produced by humans, leading to a decrease in pH levels and harming marine life, particularly coral reefs.  \n   *Source: NOAA, Ocean Acidification Program*\n\n7. **Biodiversity Loss**: Climate change is a significant driver of biodiversity loss, with an estimated 1 million species at risk of extinction due to changing climates and habitats.  \n   *Source: IPBES, Global Assessment Report on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services*\n\n8. **Economic Impact**: The economic cost of climate change is projected to reach $2.5 trillion annually by 2030 if no significant action is taken to mitigate its effects.  \n   *Source: McKinsey & Company, Climate Risk and Response*\n\n9. **Renewable Energy Growth**: Global renewable energy capacity has increased significantly, with solar and wind energy accounting for nearly 90% of the increase in total power capacity in 2020.  \n   *Source: IRENA, Renewable Capacity Statistics 2021*\n\n10. **Public Awareness and Action**: A 2021 survey found that 61% of Americans consider climate change a major threat, reflecting a growing public concern and demand for action on climate issues.  \n   *Source: Pew Research Center, The Climate Crisis and the American Public*\n\nThese facts highlight the urgency of addressing climate change and the various impacts it has on the planet and society.",
