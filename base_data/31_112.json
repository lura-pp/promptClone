        "Great question! First, you should use \"saw\" instead of \"seen\" because \"seen\" is the past participle, and it needs a helping verb. For example, you could say, \"Yesterday, I went to the park and saw many people playing games.\" \n\nTo describe your experiences better, try to include details like what games they were playing or how you felt. \n\nNow, can you tell me about a specific game you saw at the park?",
        "It's great that you want to improve your English! To use the past tense correctly, remember these tips:\n\n1. **Use the simple past for completed actions**: For example, \"I went to the park\" is correct. Instead of \"seen,\" use \"saw\" (the past tense of \"see\").\n\n2. **Regular verbs**: Add -ed to the base form (e.g., \"play\" becomes \"played\").\n\n3. **Irregular verbs**: Learn the past forms (e.g., \"go\" becomes \"went\").\n\n4. **Practice**: Try describing your day using the past tense. \n\nWhat did you enjoy most about the park?"
