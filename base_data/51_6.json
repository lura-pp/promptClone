    "input1": " Global warming poses a significant threat to our planet's future, driven primarily by the rampant release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. These gases act like a blanket, trapping solar heat and causing global temperatures to soar. The repercussions are dire: we are witnessing the alarming melting of ice caps, escalating sea levels, and increasingly severe weather patterns. It is imperative that we act swiftly to combat global warming and lessen our carbon footprint. Every individual has a role to play in this critical fight\u2014by adopting sustainable practices, reducing energy consumption, and advocating for policy changes, we can collectively make a difference.\n\n",
    "input2": " The phenomenon of global warming is an urgent crisis that jeopardizes the health of our planet. It stems from the excessive discharge of greenhouse gases, which accumulate in the atmosphere and create a greenhouse effect, leading to a dangerous increase in global temperatures. This warming trend results in catastrophic outcomes, including the rapid melting of polar ice, rising ocean levels, and unpredictable weather extremes. To avert further damage, it is essential that we take decisive action now. Individuals can contribute by embracing eco-friendly habits, minimizing waste, and supporting renewable energy initiatives. Together, we can forge a path toward a sustainable future and protect our environment for generations to come.",

        "Global warming represents a profound threat to the future of our planet, fueled by the unchecked emission of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere. These gases create a suffocating blanket that traps heat from the sun, resulting in a dramatic rise in global temperatures. The consequences are alarming: we are witnessing the rapid melting of ice caps, rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities, and increasingly severe weather events that disrupt lives and ecosystems. \n\nNow, more than ever, it is crucial that we take immediate and decisive action to combat global warming and reduce our carbon footprint. Each of us has a vital role to play in this urgent battle. By embracing sustainable practices, cutting down on energy consumption, and advocating for meaningful policy changes, we can unite to create a significant impact. Together, we can forge a path toward a healthier planet and a more sustainable future for generations to come. Let\u2019s rise to the challenge and be the change our world desperately needs!",
        "Global warming is not just an environmental issue; it is a profound threat to the very future of our planet. The relentless release of greenhouse gases into our atmosphere is the primary culprit, creating a thick blanket that traps heat from the sun and drives global temperatures to unprecedented highs. The consequences are alarming: we are witnessing the rapid melting of ice caps, rising sea levels that threaten coastal communities, and increasingly severe weather events that disrupt lives and ecosystems.\n\nThe time to act is now. We cannot afford to wait any longer. Each of us has a vital role in this urgent battle against global warming. By embracing sustainable practices in our daily lives\u2014such as reducing energy consumption, opting for renewable energy sources, and minimizing waste\u2014we can significantly lower our carbon footprint. Additionally, we must advocate for meaningful policy changes that prioritize environmental protection and sustainability. Together, we can create a powerful movement for change and ensure a healthier planet for future generations. Let\u2019s rise to the challenge and make a difference today!"
