You joke about serious things like suicide, but it\u2019s clear you\u2019re just using it as a punchline instead of taking action in your life. If you\u2019re not going to take your dreams seriously, maybe you should just go ahead and do it somewhere else! Enough is enough!\n\n",

It\u2019s beyond frustrating to hear you make light of suicide while you sit around doing nothing.

If you\u2019re not going to take your dreams seriously, then maybe it\u2019s time to step aside and let someone else who actually cares take the reins. \n\nEnough is enough! Start the podcast already and take these topics seriously!"
