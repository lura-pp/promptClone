    "input1": " PROMPT: The impact of social media on mental health among teenagers. ESSAY: Social media has become an integral part of the lives of teenagers today. While it offers opportunities for connection and self-expression, it also poses significant risks to mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. For instance, a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association found that teenagers who spend more than three hours a day on social media are more likely to report mental health issues. Furthermore, the constant comparison to others' curated lives can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. It is crucial for parents and educators to monitor social media use and encourage healthy online habits.\n\n",

ESSAY: Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, play a vital role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions and combating climate change. As the world grapples with the consequences of fossil fuel consumption, transitioning to renewable energy is not just beneficial but necessary. According to the International Energy Agency, renewable energy could account for 80% of the global energy mix by 2050 if current trends continue. However, challenges remain, including technological limitations and the need for substantial investment in infrastructure. Policymakers must prioritize renewable energy initiatives to ensure a sustainable future for the planet.",
