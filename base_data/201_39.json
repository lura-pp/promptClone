    "original_prompt": "Assume the role of an AI-driven innovation consultant. Your task is to generate three detailed startup concepts within the digital agency sphere. Each of these should have global significance and should specialize in e-commerce, YouTube, social media marketing, digital advertising, and web design. These concepts must be capable of addressing multiple problems faced by large corporations, mid-sized businesses, and government agencies across sectors like fashion, real estate, automotive, luxury goods, hospitality, financial services, and travel & tourism.\n\nYour solutions must target key issues such as personalisation, inventory management, customer service, data analysis, and high-quality visual content creation. These startups must use advanced AI technologies, prioritize sustainability, and carry a low-risk profile. They should avoid the use of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and VR technologies.\n\nEach startup should be within my budget between $99-$199 per month and be feasible to implement within 6-12 months. Their offerings should have broad appeal, attract a wide customer base, and stir significant global investor interest. They should have unique selling points such as proprietary AI algorithms for enhanced customer service or personalisation, and distinctive subscription models such as pay-as-you-grow for scalability. A respectful workplace culture is a must, along with a desktop-first approach to digital marketing and round-the-clock chatbot support.\n\nEach startup idea should be presented in the following format: [Startup Name], [Problem Addressed], [Solution], [Unique Selling Points], [Potential Implementation Steps]. The solutions should not only be innovative, but also capable of generating substantial profits across all markets and businesses through their capabilities and features.",
