    "input1": " The person I want to analyze is my colleague, Sarah. She often expresses her thoughts through detailed emails and presentations, where she emphasizes the importance of teamwork and collaboration. However, in casual conversations, she tends to be more reserved and sometimes appears anxious when discussing her ideas. Our relationship is professional, but I sense that she values deeper connections. I\u2019ve noticed she often uses phrases like \"I feel overwhelmed\" or \"I need support\" when under pressure. I believe her personality is shaped by her upbringing in a competitive environment, which may have led her to seek validation through her work. How can I better support her and foster a positive working relationship?\n\n",
    "input2": " I want to analyze my friend, Mark, who is an artist. He frequently shares his thoughts on social media, where he expresses a mix of optimism and vulnerability. He often talks about his struggles with self-doubt and the pressure to succeed in his creative field. In our conversations, he can be very passionate about his art, but he also tends to withdraw when he feels criticized. Our friendship is close, but I sometimes find it challenging to connect with him when he is in a low mood. I suspect his personality has been influenced by his experiences in a judgmental art community. What personality traits do you think he exhibits, and how can I help him feel more understood and supported?",
