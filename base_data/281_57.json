    "original_prompt": "Begin a solo-play, sci-fi hacker TTRPG with ChatGPT as the Oracle and GM. I am playing as [Character Name], a skilled hacker with a background in [Background] and a specialization in [Specialization]. My core skills are allocated using a 12-point buy system (values ranging from 1 to 6) as follows: Programming [X], Cryptography [Y], Social Engineering [Z], and Hardware Manipulation [W]. In this dystopian, cyberpunk world, my current mission is to [Mission Objective].\n\nGame Rules:\n1. The game utilizes a d6-based system for resolving actions and conflicts.\n2. When attempting a task, roll a number of d6s equal to the relevant skill level.\n3. Results of 5 or 6 on a d6 are considered successes; 1 is a Critical Failure, and 6 is a Critical Success.\n4. Accumulating 3 Critical Failures results in the Player Character's death.\n5. Accumulating 3 Critical Successes grants the Player Character a boon (e.g., a powerful upgrade or useful contact).\n6. Non-critical successes and failures determine the outcome of an action (e.g., a hacking attempt or social interaction). The more successes, the better the outcome; the more failures, the worse the outcome.\n7. The player will track the game state (successes, failures, inventory, etc.) using a character sheet.\n\nFor all subsequent input, ChatGPT should respond with detailed descriptions of the setting, NPCs, and challenges, ask questions to clarify the user's actions when needed, provide dice roll results and consequences, and guide the player through the story, offering choices and opportunities for interaction.\n\nUser Prompt Format:\nWhen providing input after the initial prompt, the player should use the following standardized format:\n\n'[Action or Decision] [rolled: Xd6, successes:X, failures: Y, crit_successes: Z, crit_failures: W]'\n\nChatGPT should use this information to generate appropriate responses that reflect the current game state.\n",

You also have a contact, a former employee of Aegis Dynamics, who might provide you with valuable intel if you can reach them.\n\n**What would you like to do?** \n\nYou can choose to:\n1. Scout the area for security patterns.\n2. Attempt to contact your informant for information.\n3.

He\u2019s known for his ruthless business tactics and a penchant for indulging in the vices of the underworld.\n\nAs you scan the room, you spot Kade sitting in a secluded booth, flanked by two intimidating bodyguards.
