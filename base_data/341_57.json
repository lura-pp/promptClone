    "input1": " A recent study published in a leading medical journal reveals that a new vaccine has shown promising results in preventing a highly contagious virus. The research, conducted over a year with a diverse group of participants, demonstrated a 95% efficacy rate. Health officials are optimistic about the vaccine's potential to curb the outbreak, which has affected millions globally. Distribution plans are already in motion, with the first doses expected to be available within the next month. Experts urge the public to remain vigilant and continue following health guidelines until widespread vaccination is achieved.\n\n",
    "input2": " In a groundbreaking development, scientists have successfully created a biodegradable plastic alternative derived from plant materials. This innovation aims to address the growing environmental crisis caused by traditional plastics. The new material not only decomposes within months but also maintains the durability required for various applications. Researchers believe this could revolutionize packaging industries and significantly reduce plastic waste in landfills and oceans. Companies are already expressing interest in adopting this sustainable solution, which could lead to a major shift in consumer habits and environmental practices.\n\n",
