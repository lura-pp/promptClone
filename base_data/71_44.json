        "Based on the event ideas provided and the factors of potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the goal of celebrating your friend's 18th birthday, here is the prioritized list of events:\n\n1. **Barbie Theme Birthday Party**\n   - **Justification**: This event has the highest potential impact as it directly celebrates your friend's birthday in a fun and engaging way. A themed party can create a memorable experience with decorations, costumes, and activities centered around Barbie, making it feel special and personalized. The feasibility is also high, as it can be organized at home or a venue with relative ease, and it aligns perfectly with the goal of making the birthday celebration super special.\n\n2. **Outdoor Movie Night Featuring Barbie Films**\n   - **Justification**: This event has a good potential impact as it can create a relaxed and enjoyable atmosphere for your friend and guests. Watching Barbie films outdoors can be a unique experience, especially if you set up a cozy environment with blankets and snacks. The feasibility is moderate; it requires access to outdoor space and equipment for screening, but it can be managed with some planning. It aligns well with the goal, as it provides a fun way to celebrate while incorporating the Barbie theme.\n\n3. **Barbie-Themed Scavenger Hunt**\n   - **Justification**: While this event can be very engaging and fun, its potential impact is slightly lower compared to the first two options. A scavenger hunt can be a great way to involve guests and create excitement, but it may require more planning and coordination to ensure it runs smoothly. The feasibility is moderate to high, depending on the location and complexity of the hunt. It aligns with the goal of celebrating the birthday, but it may not feel as special as a dedicated party or movie night.\n\nIn summary, the prioritized list is:\n1. Barbie Theme Birthday Party\n2. Outdoor Movie Night Featuring Barbie Films\n3. Barbie-Themed Scavenger Hunt\n\nThis order reflects the potential impact, feasibility, and alignment with the goal of making your friend's 18th birthday celebration super special.",

        "Based on the event ideas provided and the goal of celebrating your friend's 18th birthday in a super special way, here is the prioritized list of events along with justifications for each decision:\n\n### 1. Barbie Theme Birthday Party\n**Justification:**\n- **Potential Impact:** This event has a high impact as it directly celebrates your friend's milestone birthday in a fun and engaging way. It creates a festive atmosphere that can be memorable for both the birthday person and the guests.\n- **Feasibility:** Organizing a themed birthday party is generally feasible. It can be done at home or a rented venue, and decorations, food, and activities can be tailored to fit the Barbie theme.\n- **Alignment with the Goal:** This event aligns perfectly with the goal of making the birthday celebration special. A themed party allows for personal touches, such as favorite Barbie characters, colors, and activities that resonate with your friend.\n\n### 2. Barbie Fashion Show\n**Justification:**\n- **Potential Impact:** A fashion show can have a significant impact by providing an interactive and entertaining experience. It allows guests to showcase their creativity and engage with the Barbie theme in a unique way.\n- **Feasibility:** While slightly more complex to organize than a standard party, a fashion show can still be feasible with proper planning. It requires space for a runway, outfits, and possibly some basic sound equipment, but it can be a fun group activity.\n- **Alignment with the Goal:** This event aligns well with the goal of celebrating your friend's birthday, especially if she enjoys fashion and creativity. It adds an element of excitement and can be a highlight of the celebration.\n\n### 3. Barbie Trivia Night\n**Justification:**\n- **Potential Impact:** Trivia night can be a fun and engaging way to celebrate, but it may not have as strong of an impact as the other two options. It can foster interaction among guests but may not create the same level of excitement as a party or fashion show.\n- **Feasibility:** This event is relatively easy to organize, requiring only trivia questions, a space to gather, and possibly some prizes. However, it may not require as much effort in terms of decorations or thematic elements.\n- **Alignment with the Goal:** While it can be enjoyable, a trivia night may not feel as special or memorable as a themed party or fashion show. It may not fully capture the celebratory essence of an 18th birthday.\n\n### Summary of Prioritization:\n1. **Barbie Theme Birthday Party** - High impact, feasible, and perfectly aligns with the goal.\n2. **Barbie Fashion Show** - Significant impact, feasible with planning, and aligns well with the goal.\n3. **Barbie Trivia Night** - Fun but lower impact, easy to organize, and less aligned with the celebratory goal.\n\nThis prioritization should help you choose the best event to celebrate your friend's special day!",
