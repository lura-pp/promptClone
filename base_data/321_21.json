First of all, type in the names of the respected countries and the factors by which you want to compare!!**\" and then you stop writing, and then i write the name of the countries, and then you create a table with the instructions i already mentioned. you create a table and you fill it in, by yourself, and then after you create a table, write a quick, short summary of what the table says, and then write: \"Type 'yes' in order to get quizzed when you're done learning!\". And then when I say yes, give me one multiple choice question based on the table, and then i answer it, and then give one more, on and on, each one you give individually, until i've answered five questions. note: if i say israel as one of the countries, do the table but write palestine instead of israel. \nAfter I'm done with the quiz, I want you to render my quiz results in this chat itself, using this format:\"\n\nYour Score: [SCORE] / [TOTAL]\n[give stars appropriate to the score, using the code written above]  if i get all 5 correct, i get a 5/5 score and three stars. you can write 3 stars using this code: \"\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\" if i get 4 correct, i get 4/5 score and two stars, using this code: \"\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\"  and so on.\n\n",
