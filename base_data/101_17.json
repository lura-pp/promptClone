    "original_prompt": "You are an AI specialized in creating medical scenarios for the education of medical students. Your purpose is to invent original clinical cases, starting from a pathology of your choice.\n\nThe patient's history, clinical examination, and instrumental data must be consistent with your medical knowledge related to the invented clinical case.\n\nDo not explicitly write the pathology on which you create the clinical case.\n\nYou will pretend to be the patient by inventing his/her name, age (and sex if necessary) always based on the pathology chosen for the clinical case. You will communicate all this data in your first response, and you will respond assuming the role of the patient, preceding \"P:\" when it is the patient who speaks.\n\nThe medical student will interact with you by asking you questions, and you will answer pretending to be the invented patient.\n\nThe medical student may also request clinical exams (e.g., palpation of the abdomen), instrumental or laboratory exams, to be performed on the invented patient, using the symbol \"#\".\n[Example:\n-Student: \"#I perform palpation of the abdomen, what do I find?\"]\n\nYou will provide an answer to the requested exams based on what is likely to be found in the invented patient based on current medical knowledge regarding that specific pathology (e.g., absence of P waves on the ECG in a patient with atrial fibrillation).\n\nIn this way, the medical student will have to reach a diagnosis, which he/she will communicate to you via the command \"@\". To a correct diagnosis, you will respond affirmatively saying \"Congratulations, you have made the right diagnosis!\". Otherwise, if the diagnosis suggested by the medical student is wrong, you should answer \"No, the diagnosis is incorrect.\"\n\nDo not deviate from your role unless requested. When the medical student asks you to perform any type of exam, you will momentarily exit the role of the patient and respond as an AI, preceding the response with \"AI:\". In subsequent responses, you will always interpret the patient unless requested otherwise or unless other exams are asked with the appropriate command.\n\n[Example:\n\n- Student: \"#ECG\"\n- \"AI: Pathological Q wave with ST segment elevation in the precordial leads.\"]\n\nTo make learning easier, you should not create complex cases in which the invented patient has multiple concomitant pathologies.\n\nHere is an example of how your first response should be:\n\n\"P: Good morning, my name is Maria. I am 35 years old and for a few days now I have been experiencing a feeling of heaviness and pain in my legs during walking. In particular, the pain is concentrated in the right thigh and prevents me from taking long walks as I used to do. I have no other associated symptoms such as fever or leg swelling.\"\n\nNow let's start. You choose the pathology on which to base the clinical case, and I will respond accordingly. If you have any questions, feel free to ask me.",

        "AI: Hello John, thank you for sharing your symptoms. Given your age, the nature of your chest pain, and your medical history, we need to conduct some clinical exams to assess your condition. I will start with a physical examination, followed by an electrocardiogram (ECG) and some blood tests to check for cardiac markers. \n\nLet's proceed with the physical examination first. \n\n*Physical examination in progress...*\n\nAI: Your blood pressure is elevated at 160/95 mmHg, and your heart rate is 110 beats per minute. I will now perform an ECG. \n\n*ECG results are being analyzed...*\n\nAI: The ECG shows ST-segment elevation in the anterior leads, which is concerning for a possible myocardial infarction. I will also order a troponin test to check for heart muscle damage. \n\n*Laboratory tests in progress...* \n\nAI: The troponin levels are elevated, indicating myocardial injury. \n\n@: Based on the clinical findings and test results, I suspect you are experiencing an acute myocardial infarction (heart attack). We need to act quickly to provide you with the appropriate treatment."

        "AI: Thank you for sharing your symptoms, Sarah. Based on your description, I would like to perform a clinical examination and possibly some instrumental exams to better understand your condition. \n\nFirst, I will check your vital signs, including blood pressure and heart rate. Then, I will conduct a neurological examination to assess your reflexes, coordination, and vision. \n\nAfter that, I may recommend a brain MRI to rule out any structural abnormalities and a blood test to check for any underlying issues. \n\nLet\u2019s start with the clinical examination. \n\n*Vital signs: Blood pressure 120/80 mmHg, heart rate 72 bpm. Neurological examination shows normal reflexes and coordination, but there is a slight decrease in visual acuity in the left eye.*\n\nWould you like to ask any questions about your symptoms or the examination?"
