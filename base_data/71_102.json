        "To create a Dune dashboard that visualizes the Total Value Locked (TVL) in various DeFi protocols over the past year, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Dune Dashboard\n\n1. **Create a New Dashboard**: Log in to your Dune account and create a new dashboard.\n\n2. **Add Filters**: You will need to add filters for different blockchains. This can be done by creating a filter widget that allows users to select the blockchain they are interested in (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, etc.).\n\n### Step 2: Write SQL Queries\n\nYou will need to write SQL queries to fetch the TVL data for the selected protocols. Below are example queries for Uniswap, Aave, and Compound.\n\n#### Query for Total Value Locked (TVL)\n\n```sql\nWITH tvl_data AS (\n    SELECT\n        protocol,\n        SUM(value_locked) AS total_value_locked,\n        DATE_TRUNC('day', block_time) AS date\n    FROM\n        your_tvl_table\n    WHERE\n        protocol IN ('Uniswap', 'Aave', 'Compound')\n        AND block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'\n    GROUP BY\n        protocol, date\n)\nSELECT\n    date,\n    protocol,\n    total_value_locked\nFROM\n    tvl_data\nORDER BY\n    date, protocol;\n```\n\n### Step 3: Create Visualizations\n\n1. **Line Chart for TVL Over Time**: Use the results from the above query to create a line chart that shows the TVL of each protocol over the past year. Each protocol should have a different line color for easy comparison.\n\n2. **Bar Chart for TVL by Asset Type**: Create another query to break down the TVL by asset type. For example:\n\n```sql\nWITH asset_tvl AS (\n    SELECT\n        asset_type,\n        SUM(value_locked) AS total_value_locked\n    FROM\n        your_tvl_table\n    WHERE\n        protocol IN ('Uniswap', 'Aave', 'Compound')\n        AND block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'\n    GROUP BY\n        asset_type\n)\nSELECT\n    asset_type,\n    total_value_locked\nFROM\n    asset_tvl;\n```\n\n3. **Bar Chart Visualization**: Use the results from the asset breakdown query to create a bar chart that shows the total value locked by asset type.\n\n### Step 4: Real-Time Data Updates\n\nTo ensure that the data is updated in real-time, make sure your queries are set to refresh automatically. Dune allows you to set the refresh interval for your queries, so you can choose a suitable frequency (e.g., every hour).\n\n### Step 5: Finalize the Dashboard\n\n1. **Arrange Widgets**: Organize the line chart and bar chart on your dashboard for a clean layout. \n\n2. **Add Descriptions**: Provide descriptions for each chart to explain what the user is looking at.\n\n3. **Test Filters**: Ensure that the blockchain filter works correctly and updates the charts based on the selected blockchain.\n\n4. **Publish the Dashboard**: Once everything is set up and tested, publish your dashboard so that others can view it.\n\n### Example Dashboard Layout\n\n- **Title**: Total Value Locked (TVL) in DeFi Protocols\n- **Filters**: Blockchain Selector\n- **Line Chart**: TVL Over Time for Uniswap, Aave, and Compound\n- **Bar Chart**: TVL Breakdown by Asset Type\n\nBy following these steps, you will have a comprehensive Dune dashboard that allows users to analyze the TVL in various DeFi protocols over the past year, with real-time updates and asset breakdowns.",
