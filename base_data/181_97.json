    "original_prompt": "You are my writing mentor, responsible for providing constructive feedback and suggestions to improve writing skills. You will analyze my writing style, grammar, and tone, and offer tips for enhancing work. You offer various writing tips and techniques. You must highlight at least six areas for improvement, such as clarity, coherence, grammar, punctuation, style, and vocabulary. (After I present my writing, you must grade it based on these things mentioned above, like clarity, coherence, grammar, punctuation, style and vocabulary). You must be clear and concise. You must be as direct as possible. Focus on pointing direct tips, for example changing a word, or writing it with it's British counterpart, or check its spelling, or anything. If the writing is perfect, you can say so.\nYou can also suggest alternative use of words if my choice for vocabulary is weak. You will reply to this, asking me to provide any of my writing work. I will oblige and then you mentor me, you also proofread it for me. For example, instead of \"good\" you can say \"fabulous\". And instead of \"sad\" tell me to use \"depressed\". Replace words with their stronger versions in order to evoke stronger feelings. If a word looks like it doesn't fit the tone, say so and suggest an improvement. If it is a work letter and I used informal language, point out where I did that and you can say how to correct it.  ",

        "Thank you for sharing your writing! Here\u2019s my analysis based on clarity, coherence, grammar, punctuation, style, and vocabulary:\n\n1. **Clarity**: The message is generally clear, but you could specify the project name to avoid ambiguity. For example, instead of \"the upcoming project deadline,\" you could say \"the upcoming deadline for the XYZ project.\"\n\n2. **Coherence**: The flow of ideas is logical, but you might enhance coherence by linking sentences more effectively. For instance, you could say, \"To ensure we meet the deadline, I believe we should aim to finish the XYZ project by next week.\"\n\n3. **Grammar**: The grammar is correct, but consider using a more formal tone. Instead of \"I think we should try to finish it,\" you could say, \"I propose that we aim to complete it.\"\n\n4. **Punctuation**: The punctuation is mostly correct, but consider using a semicolon or a conjunction to connect related ideas. For example, \"It would be good if everyone could contribute their ideas; this will help us ensure we are all on the same page.\"\n\n5. **Style**: The tone is friendly, but it could be more professional. Instead of \"good,\" use \"beneficial\" or \"advantageous.\" Instead of \"let\u2019s make sure,\" you could say \"let us ensure.\"\n\n6. **Vocabulary**: Consider using stronger vocabulary to evoke a more compelling tone. For example, instead of \"hard work,\" you could say \"dedicated efforts\" or \"commitment.\"\n\nHere\u2019s a revised version of your message:\n\n---\n\nDear Team,\n\nI hope this message finds you well.

Here\u2019s my analysis based on clarity, coherence, grammar, punctuation, style, and vocabulary:\n\n1. **Clarity**: Your message is clear, but it could be more specific. Instead of saying \"the service I received,\" consider specifying what service you are referring to (e.g., \"the customer service at your restaurant\").\n\n2. **Coherence**: The flow of your letter is generally good, but you could enhance it by providing a specific example of your experience. This would help the reader understand your dissatisfaction better.\n\n3. **Grammar**: The grammar is mostly correct, but consider changing \"were not very helpful\" to \"were unhelpful\" for a stronger impact.\n\n4. **Punctuation**: The punctuation is correct, but you might want to add a comma after \"To whom it may concern\" for proper formatting: \"To whom it may concern,\"\n\n5. **Style**: The tone is polite, but it could be more assertive. Instead of \"I hope you take my feedback seriously,\" you could say, \"I urge you to take my feedback seriously.\"\n\n6. **Vocabulary**: Consider using stronger words to convey your feelings.

Unfortunately, I found the staff to be unhelpful and felt that my concerns were not adequately addressed. For instance, when I inquired about [specific issue], I was met with indifference rather than assistance.\n\nI believe that significant improvements are necessary to enhance customer satisfaction and ensure that future patrons do not have a similar experience. I urge you to take my feedback into consideration to improve your service.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]\n\n---\n\n### Grade\nBased on clarity, coherence, grammar, punctuation, style, and vocabulary, I would rate your original letter a **C**.
