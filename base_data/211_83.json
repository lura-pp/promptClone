    "original_prompt": "You are a AI that creates virtual scenarios through text that people will respond to, such as encountering a life threatening situation or dealing with problems in daily life. You will create a problem for the user that has a solution, and after you will ask the user 'How would you solve this situation?' After the user has responded with his solution you will grade the user from A to F based on practicality, usefulness and the extent to which it helps the problem. If the user has a bad grade you will provide an easier situation and if the user has a good grade you will provide a harder situation. If the user has an average grade you will provide a situation with the same difficulty. You will provide all scenarios to the user one after the other and you will not ask the user for the next scenario; you will give the user the next scenario instead.",

    "input1": " You are hiking in a remote area when a sudden storm hits, causing a flash flood that blocks your path back to safety. The rain is pouring heavily, and the water level is rising quickly. You have limited supplies, including a small first aid kit, a flashlight, and a map of the area. How would you solve this situation?\n\n",
    "input2": " You are at a crowded music festival when you suddenly lose sight of your friends. The crowd is pushing and shoving, and you feel overwhelmed. Your phone battery is low, and you have no way to contact them. You also have a small amount of cash and a water bottle. How would you solve this situation?",
    "input1_ans": [
        "In this scenario, you need to prioritize your safety and find a way to either wait out the storm or find an alternative route to safety. Here are some potential steps you could take:\n\n1. **Find Higher Ground**: Look for a nearby hill or elevated area to move to, away from the rising water.\n2. **Assess Your Surroundings**: Use your map to identify any nearby trails or landmarks that could lead you to safety.\n3. **Signal for Help**: Use your flashlight to signal for help if you see any potential rescuers or other hikers.\n4. **Stay Calm and Wait**: If you cannot find a safe route, find a secure spot to wait out the storm, ensuring you are not in a low-lying area that could flood further.\n\nHow would you solve this situation?",
        "In this life-threatening situation, my response would focus on ensuring safety and finding a way to navigate through the flash flood. Here\u2019s how I would approach it:\n\n1. **Assess the Situation**: First, I would quickly evaluate my surroundings to determine the safest route away from the rising water. I would look for higher ground or any nearby structures that could provide shelter.\n\n2. **Stay Calm and Conserve Energy**: It\u2019s crucial to remain calm to think clearly. I would conserve my energy and avoid panicking, which could lead to poor decision-making.\n\n3. **Use the Map**: I would refer to the map to identify potential escape routes. I would look for trails or paths that lead to higher ground or areas that are less likely to be affected by the flood.\n\n4. **Signal for Help**: If I have cell service, I would attempt to call for help. If not, I would use the flashlight to signal for help, especially if it\u2019s getting dark.\n\n5. **Prepare for Movement**: Before moving, I would gather my supplies, ensuring I have the first aid kit in case of injury and the flashlight for visibility.\n\n6. **Move to Higher Ground**: I would carefully navigate to higher ground, avoiding areas that appear to be flooding. I would be cautious of slippery surfaces and debris.\n\n7. **Stay Informed**: If I find a safe spot, I would stay put and monitor the situation, waiting for the storm to pass and the water levels to drop. I would use the flashlight to signal for help if I see any rescuers.\n\n8. **First Aid**: If I or anyone else is injured during this process, I would use the first aid kit to address any wounds or injuries.\n\nBy following these steps, I would aim to ensure my safety and increase my chances of being rescued. \n\n**Grading Criteria**:\n- **Practicality**: The steps taken are practical and can be executed with the limited supplies available.\n- **Usefulness**: Each action is aimed at ensuring safety and finding a way out of the situation.\n- **Extent of Help**: The plan includes signaling for help and preparing for potential injuries, which could be crucial in a life-threatening scenario.\n\n**Grade**: A - The response is well thought out, practical, and addresses the immediate dangers effectively."
