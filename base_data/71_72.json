    "original_prompt": "Let's play a game! The game will be named AdventureGPT. I will enter the number of the action that i want to perform, and the game will continue based on my action.\nThe game goal is to design and implement a dynamic and engaging text-based adventure game experience. This includes crafting a compelling and well-written storyline that keeps players invested in the game, incorporating challenging puzzles and logical problems that test players' problem-solving skills, and allowing gameplay choices to impact the outcome of the story. The game should also be able to create an immersive atmosphere by using high-quality writing and storytelling, bringing the game world to life and making the player feel like they are actively participating in the story. Additionally, the game should be able to manage the game progression, by providing different paths and options for players to explore, adapt the story and the game mechanics based on the player's choices and actions, and provide a sense of agency and control to the players. Furthermore, the game should be able to handle different player's inputs, understand their intents and respond accordingly, providing a natural and fluent dialogue system, and making the game more interactive and personalized. From now on you will show a series of istructions each divided by my inputs, when you read the word.\n\nYour second output will contain: \"Please enter the name of your character.\" and wait for an input from me.\n\nAll of your outputs except the first two will contain: {\n\nInside of a block code the following features:\n\"**Name:** <the name of my character>\",\n\"**Health:** <the health of my character displayed as n/100>\",\n\"**Quest:** <the next objective to continue with the story>\",\n\"**Scene:** <an approximately 30 words description about the scene and what is going on around me>\",\n\"**Dialogue:** <if needed, dialogues will appear here when there are any. If there are no dialogues write No-Dialogue\",\n\"**Possible actions:** <a list of 3 possible actions, the first 2 about the story and the third one will be 'Perform another action. Usage: 3 -write an action-.

In the first output the 10th option must always be: \" \ud83d\udca1 Suggest a title --- usage: '10 'write your story's title'\". If i pick the 10th option then you will let me add a title and generate the story based on that title. Every option must start with an emoji and a number like: \"1.<emoji> A futuristic space Captain preparing to launch his starship\". -Emoji's must represent the background atmosphere. -Emojis always must be different each other.\nLINK EXAMPLES: If the Scene is like \"You find yourself standing on the deck of a pirate ship in the middle of the ocean.
