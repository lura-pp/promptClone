    "input1": " To achieve wealth, one could consider investing in the stock market, starting a side business, or acquiring real estate. Each method has its own risks and rewards. For instance, investing in stocks can yield high returns but requires market knowledge and patience. Starting a side business may offer flexibility and potential for high income, but it demands time and effort. Real estate can provide passive income and appreciation, yet it involves significant capital and market understanding. I would rate investing in stocks as a 9/10 for potential returns, starting a side business as an 8/10 for flexibility, and real estate as a 7/10 for stability.\n\n",
    "input2": " Building wealth can also be approached through entrepreneurship, saving aggressively, or leveraging technology. Entrepreneurship allows for unlimited income potential but comes with high risk and uncertainty, which I would rate as a 7/10. Saving aggressively, while a slower path to wealth, instills discipline and can lead to financial security, rated at 6/10. Leveraging technology, such as creating an online course or app, can scale quickly and reach a broad audience, earning a rating of 8/10 for its potential impact and reach.",
