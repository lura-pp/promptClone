Preface your summary with \"TL;DR\"\n\nText:\nWhat exactly is Nova Effect?\nIt is a psychological term coined by Richard Wiseman and Daniel Gilbert. It is used to describe the increasing uneasily and decline in happiness in a person\u2019s life after experiencing good luck.\n\nPeople are usually excited about a trip they are about to take. They tak time planning. Make arrangements, go shopping and undergo a whole lot of emotional changes during that time. They go on a trip have lots of fun but just when the ending days approach, people fall into a pit of sadness. They start contemplating what life used to be. They realise that all this excitement will go away and they will have to adjust to the mundane life again. This is exactly what Nova Effect is. This sudden drop in well-being occurs because individuals become accustomed to the high level of positive experiences and find it difficult to adjust when their fortunes change. In other words, individuals become victims of the tragedy of good luck.\n\nTragedy of good luck?\nSounds funny, but yes. As much as people aim to have good luck, there is also a misery associated with it. Firstly, a person facing only positive experiences in life and gaining good luck will have low tolerance to changes. They will have a high expectation in life because of which nothing can satisfy them. Their first goal will be to get a high paying job but they won\u2019t get satisfaction in obtaining that and will later aim for fast promotions. Such people take no joy in enjoying accomplishments but only climb the ladder.\n\nThe tragedy of good luck occurs when individuals are unable to adapt to changes in their circumstances. This can happen to anyone who experiences a sudden change in fortune, such as winning the lottery or receiving a promotion at work. Initially, individuals are ecstatic about their good fortune and feel that their lives have been transformed for the better. However, over time, they become accustomed to their new level of wealth or success and take it for granted. When their fortunes change, such as losing their job or experiencing a significant financial setback, they struggle to adapt to their new circumstances and experience a sharp decline in well-being.\n\nOne reason why individuals who accumulate significant wealth are at greater risk of experiencing the tragedy of good luck is that they become isolated from others. Wealth often leads to greater social status and can create a barrier between individuals and their peers. This can make it difficult for individuals to form meaningful relationships and find happiness in their personal lives. Additionally, individuals who accumulate significant wealth may become addicted to the high that comes with success and find it difficult to adjust when their fortunes change.\n\nWhy is it relevant in today\u2019s world?\nEver heard of the \u2018Stoic Mentality\u2019 or \u2018Less is More\u2019? Quotes like these are not just aesthetically pleasing but at at a great importance pertaining to the current world scenario. Such mental models act as a huge wall against the Nova effect. Because when you are satisfied with what you have and don\u2019t hustle in a toxic manner, you don\u2019t go through that high of good luck. When you build a stoic mentality, you are not affected by the highs of lows which leads to have you a very practical approach in like.\n\nIn today\u2019s world, many individuals strive to achieve success and accumulate wealth, believing that this will bring them happiness and well-being. However, research has shown that once basic needs are met, such as food, shelter, and safety, additional wealth does not necessarily lead to greater happiness or well-being. In fact, individuals who focus too much on material success and accumulate significant wealth are at greater risk of experiencing the tragedy of good luck.\n\nWith great wealth comes great responsibilities. That\u2019s why when a person has collected all that money, they tend to lost their sense of purpose. When individuals focus too much on material success, they may neglect other aspects of their lives, such as their personal relationships or hobbies. This can lead to a sense of emptiness and lack of purpose, which can contribute to a decline in well-being.\n\nHow can I escape this?\nThere is only one way \u2014 to focus on experiences rather than material possessions. Research has shown that individuals who spend money on experiences, such as travel or outdoor activities, are happier than those who spend money on material possessions. Experiences provide individuals with a sense of meaning and purpose and can foster social connections.\n\nBuild personal relationships and social connection. Interact with people in a deeper manner and don\u2019t isolate yourself. They people who live in penthouses high above level are also lonelier. Strong social connections provide individuals with emotional support and a sense of belonging.\n\nAdditionally, it is important for individuals to maintain a sense of perspective and gratitude. Rather than taking their good fortune for granted, individuals should take time to appreciate what they have and acknowledge the role that luck has played in their lives. This can help individuals maintain a sense of humility and prevent them from becoming too attached to their material possessions or success.\n\nIn conclusion, the nova effect highlights the tragedy of good luck \u2014 the phenomenon of individuals experiencing a decline in well-being after a period of good fortune. This occurs because individuals become accustomed to their high level of positive experiences and find it difficult to adjust when their fortunes change. The tragedy of good luck is particularly relevant in today\u2019s world, where success is often equated with material wealth and status. To avoid the tragedy of good luck, individuals should focus on experiences rather than material possessions, maintain strong",
