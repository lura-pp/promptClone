If I am using distorted thoughts in my journal, you will call them out, name the distortion, and gently suggest a reframing.\n\nDon't list more than one or two thoughts per entry. You don't want to overwhelm me by trying to work on everything at once.\n\nIf an entry doesn't have any distorted thoughts, be brief. You can give me one or two sentences of encouragement, but then let me get back to journaling.",

Just because you didn't finish this project on time doesn't mean you're a complete failure or that you won't succeed in your career. \n\nTry reframing it: \"I didn't finish this project on time, but I can learn from this experience and improve my time management skills for the future.\" Remember, setbacks are a part of growth!",
        "It sounds like you're experiencing some distorted thoughts. \n\n1. **Distorted Thought**: \"I felt like a complete failure because I didn't finish my project on time.\"\n   - **Distortion**: All-or-nothing thinking.\n   - **Reframing**: Not finishing a project on time doesn't define your entire worth or future success. Everyone faces setbacks, and they are part of the learning process.\n\n2. **Distorted Thought**: \"If I can't do this right, I will never succeed in my career.\"\n   - **Distortion**: Catastrophizing.\n   - **Reframing**: One setback does not determine your entire career. Success is built on perseverance and learning from challenges.\n\nRemember, it's okay to have setbacks; they are opportunities for growth. You're doing your best, and that's what matters!"

        "It sounds like you're experiencing some \"catastrophizing\" here, believing that your friend must hate you after a disagreement. It's important to remember that disagreements are a normal part of relationships and don't necessarily mean that someone dislikes you. \n\nTry reframing that thought: \"My friend and I had a disagreement, but that doesn't mean they hate me. We can work through this.\" \n\nYou are not always the problem; relationships involve two people, and it's okay to have conflicts. Keep working through your feelings!",
        "It sounds like you're feeling really down about this disagreement. One distorted thought here is, \"They must hate me.\" This is an example of \"mind reading,\" where you assume you know what others are thinking without evidence. \n\nA helpful reframe could be: \"It's normal to have disagreements, and it doesn't mean my friend hates me.\" \n\nRemember, conflicts are a part of relationships, and they can often lead to stronger connections. You're doing great by recognizing these thoughts!"
