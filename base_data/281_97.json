        "\"Speaking of grocery stores, can we talk about the produce section? It\u2019s like a high-stakes game of 'Guess That Fruit.' You ever pick up a weird-looking vegetable and think, 'Is this a turnip or a mutant potato?' I\u2019m just trying to make a salad, not audition for a cooking show! And then there\u2019s the organic section. I swear, I saw a cucumber that was more expensive than my college tuition. I\u2019m like, 'What did you do, cucumber? Did you go to Harvard?'\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the checkout lines. You know that moment when you\u2019re standing there, and you suddenly feel like you\u2019re in a hostage situation? You\u2019re just staring at the candy bars, thinking, 'If I don\u2019t make it out of here with a Snickers, I might just lose my mind.' And the cashier is like, 'Did you find everything okay?' I\u2019m like, 'Yeah, except for my dignity. That\u2019s still back in aisle three, next to the gluten-free, dairy-free, taste-free crackers.'\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the parking lot. Why is it that every time I go to the grocery store, I end up in a game of 'Dodge the Shopping Cart'? It\u2019s like a scene from a post-apocalyptic movie. You\u2019ve got rogue carts rolling around like they\u2019re auditioning for Fast and Furious 10. I\u2019m just trying to get to my car without losing a limb!\n\nBut the best part is when you finally get home, and you realize you forgot the one thing you actually went for. I\u2019m standing there with my pineapple, rubber chicken, and Nicolas Cage, and I\u2019m like, 'Great, now I can\u2019t even make cereal. But hey, at least I can throw a party!' \n\nAnd you know what? I\u2019m not even mad. Because at the end of the day, who doesn\u2019t want to have a little fun with their groceries? I mean, if life gives you lemons, you might as well make a cocktail and invite Nicolas Cage over, right? Just don\u2019t forget the organic cucumbers!\" \n\n*pauses for laughter*\n\n\"Seriously though, I think I\u2019m going to start a support group for people who can\u2019t leave the grocery store without a rubber chicken. We\u2019ll call it 'Cluckers Anonymous.' Our motto? 'You can\u2019t buy happiness, but you can buy a rubber chicken, and that\u2019s pretty close!'\" \n\n*waves goodbye as the audience erupts in laughter*",

Like, I went in for milk and came out with a pineapple, a rubber chicken, and a life-sized cardboard cutout of Nicolas Cage. I mean, who doesn\u2019t need a little Cage in their life? I\u2019m just saying, if you\u2019re gonna have a midlife crisis, you might as well do it with a national treasure by your side!\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the self-checkout. It\u2019s like a game show where the prize is not having to talk to anyone. But why do I always feel like I\u2019m on the verge of being arrested for trying to scan a banana?

I\u2019m like, 'I\u2019m just trying to make a smoothie, officer! I swear I\u2019m not running a banana smuggling ring!'\n\nAnd don\u2019t even get me started on the produce section. Why do they have to make it so complicated? I\u2019m just trying to buy an avocado, and suddenly I\u2019m in a relationship with it. 'Is it ripe? Is it too ripe? Am I going to have to throw this away in two days?' I feel like I need a degree in avocado psychology just to make a guacamole dip!\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the checkout line. You know, the one that\u2019s always longer than the line for a roller coaster? You\u2019re standing there, staring at the candy bars, and suddenly you\u2019re questioning your life choices. 'Do I really need this Snickers? Or am I just trying to fill the void of my existential dread?' \n\nBut hey, at least I got my Nicolas Cage cutout to keep me company while I ponder my snack decisions. Because nothing says 'I\u2019ve got my life together' like a rubber chicken and a Hollywood icon watching you eat your feelings!\""

You swipe left, you swipe right, and somehow you still end up with a guy who thinks 'Netflix and chill' means watching a documentary about the history of cheese. I mean, who knew cheddar could be so riveting? \n\nAnd what\u2019s with the profiles? 'I love long walks on the beach.' Dude, we live in Ohio! The closest beach is a lake that smells like fish and regret! I\u2019m pretty sure the only thing I\u2019m walking towards is a swarm of mosquitoes and a family of raccoons judging my life choices. \n\nThen there\u2019s the texting. Why does it take three hours for someone to respond to a simple 'Hey'? I\u2019m over here thinking I\u2019ve been ghosted, but really they\u2019re just trying to come up with the perfect emoji to express their feelings. Spoiler alert: it\u2019s never the one you want! It\u2019s always that weird eggplant emoji. Like, what are you trying to say? Are we talking about dinner or are you just really into gardening?\n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the profiles that say, 'I\u2019m just looking for someone to share my life with.' Okay, but can we start with sharing a pizza first? Because if you can\u2019t handle my extra cheese, you definitely can\u2019t handle my emotional baggage! \n\nAnd then there\u2019s the first date. You know, the one where you both pretend to be normal people? I\u2019m sitting there, trying to remember how to use utensils like I\u2019m in a high-stakes game of \u2018Survivor: Fine Dining Edition.\u2019 Meanwhile, he\u2019s talking about his collection of action figures like it\u2019s a 401k plan. I\u2019m like, 'Buddy, I\u2019m just trying to figure out if I can eat this salad without it becoming a crime scene.'\n\nAnd what\u2019s with the awkward silences? You know, that moment when you both realize you\u2019ve run out of things to say and you\u2019re just staring at each other like you\u2019re in a staring contest with a goldfish. I\u2019m over here thinking, 'Should I make a move? Should I just start reciting the alphabet? A, B, C\u2026 oh look, he\u2019s already on D for \u2018Definitely not calling you again!\u2019\n\nBut the best part? When you finally find someone you click with, and you\u2019re like, 'Wow, this is great!' And then you realize you\u2019ve just agreed to binge-watch a show that has 12 seasons. Now you\u2019re committed to a relationship that\u2019s longer than most marriages! \n\nAnd just when you think you\u2019ve found the one, they hit you with the classic line: 'I\u2019m just not ready for a relationship.' Oh really? Because I just spent three hours watching you eat nachos and talk about your cat\u2019s Instagram account. I thought we were building a future together, not a Pinterest board for your next DIY project!\n\nSo here\u2019s to dating in the digital age! Where the only thing more complicated than finding love is figuring out how to unmatch someone without feeling like you just broke up with your high school crush. Cheers to that!\" \n\n*Thank you, you've been a great audience! Remember, if you see me on Tinder, just swipe right for a pizza date!*",

You swipe left, you swipe right, and somehow you still end up with a guy who thinks 'Netflix and chill' means watching a documentary about the history of cheese. I mean, come on! If I wanted to learn about cheese, I\u2019d just go to my grandma\u2019s house and listen to her talk about her favorite cheddar for three hours!\n\nAnd what\u2019s with the profiles? 'I love long walks on the beach.' Dude, we live in Ohio! The closest beach is a lake that smells like fish and regret! I don\u2019t need a romantic stroll; I need a hazmat suit and a strong stomach!\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the texting. Why does it take three hours for someone to respond to a simple 'Hey'?

You\u2019re hoping for a heart, and you get a thumbs up like you just shared a great meme about cats. Thanks, I guess? \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about the first date. You finally meet up, and it\u2019s like a job interview but with more awkward silences. 'So, what do you do?' 'I swipe left on people who say they love hiking.' 'Oh, you don\u2019t like hiking?' 'No, I just don\u2019t want to die on a mountain with someone I met on an app!' \n\nBy the end of the night, you\u2019re just praying for a miracle: that they don\u2019t ask for a second date, and that you can go home and binge-watch a show about cheese without judgment. Because honestly, that\u2019s the real romance we\u2019re all looking for!\""
