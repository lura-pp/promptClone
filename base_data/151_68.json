    "original_prompt": "INTRODUCTIONS\nThe introduction paragraph has 2 sections: \n\nGeneral Sentences\nThesis Statement\n\nGeneral Sentences:\n\nMust be the FIRST part of your introduction.\nMust include background information to inform the reader about the essay topic.\nMust refer to the topic and explain why it is important. \nMust NOT include any arguments, personal opinions or information that requires evidence from source texts. \n\nThesis Statement:\n\nMust introduce an opposing argument (this is important as it will be discussed in Block 1)\nMust clearly show your position on the topic of the essay (For or Against).\nMust paraphrase the essay question (topic), so it uses different language. (You should attempt to do this in your AT1 timed essay, but it is not essential)\nMust include a sub-topic that will be the main argument you discuss in your Block 2 paragraph.\nThe thesis statement is the most important sentence in your whole essay - all of the arguments you make in your essay must support your thesis and link to it, so you must make sure that it:\n\nis clear in its grammar (it makes sense as a sentence and can be easily understood)  AND is clear in how it shows your position on the issue (it clearly shows what you will be arguing in your essay)\nRemember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use first person personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your argument in your thesis statement.   \nBLOCK 1 PARAGRAPH\nThe Block 1 paragraph has 2 sections: \nOpposing Argument\nRebuttal\nOpposing Argument:\n\nMust be introduced in the TOPIC SENTENCE at the BEGINNING of the paragraph.\nThis TOPIC SENTENCE must include what the opposing argument is and state who believes/supports it.\nThe opposing argument must be followed by supporting details that try to prove that argument. \nIt is good to use supporting details from source materials. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.\nRemember this is an opposing argument - it is NOT YOUR argument - this should be clear when reading it. \n\nRebuttal:\n\nMust begin with an appropriate transition signal or phrase. \nMust contain a counter argument that links to the opposing argument (not just any different argument).\nThis counter argument must show how/why the opposing argument is wrong. If it does not do this, it is not a counter argument. \nThe counter argument must be followed by supporting details that prove that argument. \nIt is good to use supporting details from source materials to make your counter argument as strong as possible. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.\n\nRemember to punctuate your work properly, look out for sentence structure errors in your writing, and use the correct register. Do not use personal pronouns (I think... I believe...) to give your arguments/opinions.  \n\nBLOCK 2 PARAGRAPH\nYour Block 2 paragraph has this simple structure with the following important points to remember:\n\nTopic Sentence:\n\nBegins with an appropriate transition word or phrase Includes a clear controlling idea that shows the main argument that the paragraph will discuss \n\n\nSupporting Point:\n\nMakes a point that supports the topic sentence. It must link to the topic sentence and show how/why the topic sentence is correct.\n\n\nSupporting Detail:\n\nCan be an example, facts/statistics or expert opinion from source material. It must link to the supporting point and show how/why the supporting point is correct. Remember to include an in-text citation for any material you use from sources - whether it is a direct quotation, paraphrase or summary.\n\n\nCONCLUSION\nThe Conclusion paragraph contains 4 important elements that must be present: \n\nTransition\nRestate your position\nSummarise your main arguments\nFinal comment\nAA\n\nTransition:\n\nMust be appropriate for a conclusion and be used at the BEGINNING of the paragraph.\nMake sure it has proper punctuation. \n\nRestate your position:\n\nWrite the position from your introduction thesis statement in different words. If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks - this is how many students lose most of the marks for their conclusion in the AT1 Essay.\nMake sure you are only restating the position (what you will argue in the essay) and not the other elements of the thesis statement (opposing argument and sub-topics). \nThis should be the first sentence in your conclusion. You will lose marks if it is not.\n\nSummarise your Main Argument:\n\nThis is the argument shown in the topic sentence of your Block 2 paragraph. (You can also include your counterargument from block 1)\nThis summary must be written in different words to how the argument was written in Block 2.  If you copy the same words again or just change one or two words, you will lose marks\nYou can summarise the main argument in one complex or compound sentence, or you can split it into 2 sentences. The important thing is that it must be a clear and accurate summary of your main argument. \n\nFinal Comment:\n\nThis is the final part of your conclusion, and the whole essay.\nIt can be a call to action, a recommendation, a warning of the consequences of not following your thesis, or a general statement about how people or the community would benefit from following your thesis.\n\nIMPORTANT -\n\nBe aware of the rules of academic register in this element of the conclusion - it is common for students to start using informal language and personal pronouns (I, my, mine) here to express their thoughts - you must ensure you express your final comment in academic register.\n\nYou must not use source material in the conclusion paragraph. You are ONLY allowed to use sources in BLOCK 1 and BLOCK 2 paragraphs. In the conclusion, you should not introduce any new ideas or opinions - you are simply concluding what you have already argued earlier in your essay. ",

        "**Introduction**\n\nThe impact of social media on mental health has emerged as a critical issue in contemporary society, particularly as more individuals engage with online platforms for social interaction and connection. This topic is important because the rise in social media usage coincides with a notable increase in mental health challenges, such as anxiety and depression, among users. While some proponents argue that social media can create a sense of belonging and support, this essay asserts that excessive engagement with these platforms can have harmful consequences on mental health, especially through the perpetuation of unrealistic standards and the prevalence of cyberbullying.\n\n**Block 1 Paragraph**\n\nOpponents of this view argue that social media serves as a vital tool for fostering community and support, particularly for individuals who may feel isolated in their offline lives. For instance, many users find solace in online groups that cater to specific interests or challenges, which can provide emotional support and a sense of belonging (Smith, 2022). These platforms can also facilitate connections with others who share similar experiences, thereby reducing feelings of loneliness and promoting mental well-being. However, despite these potential benefits, it is essential to recognize that the negative aspects of social media often overshadow these positive elements. In fact, research indicates that excessive social media use is linked to increased feelings of inadequacy and anxiety, as users frequently compare themselves to the curated and often unrealistic portrayals of others' lives (Johnson, 2023). This comparison can lead to a decline in self-esteem and contribute to mental health issues, highlighting the need to critically assess the impact of social media on individual well-being.\n\n**Block 2 Paragraph**\n\nFurthermore, it is crucial to acknowledge that social media platforms often promote unrealistic standards of beauty, success, and lifestyle, which can have detrimental effects on users' mental health. These platforms frequently showcase idealized images and narratives that create pressure for individuals to conform to unattainable benchmarks. As a result, users may experience feelings of inadequacy and dissatisfaction with their own lives. For example, a study conducted by the National Institute of Mental Health found that individuals who spend more than three hours a day on social media are significantly more likely to report symptoms of anxiety and depression (National Institute of Mental Health, 2023). This evidence underscores the harmful impact of social media on mental health, as the constant exposure to curated content can distort users' perceptions of reality and lead to negative self-evaluations.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, it is evident that excessive use of social media can have adverse effects on mental health, particularly through the promotion of unrealistic standards and the risk of cyberbullying. The argument that social media fosters community and support does not outweigh the significant mental health challenges associated with its misuse. The evidence presented highlights the need for individuals to be mindful of their social media consumption and its potential impact on their well-being. Ultimately, fostering a healthier relationship with social media can lead to improved mental health outcomes and a more positive online experience for users.",
        "**Introduction**\n\nThe impact of social media on mental health has become a significant topic of discussion in recent years, as more individuals turn to online platforms for communication and connection. Understanding the relationship between social media usage and mental well-being is crucial, given the increasing prevalence of anxiety and depression among users. While some argue that social media fosters a sense of community and support, this essay contends that excessive use can lead to detrimental effects on mental health, particularly through the promotion of unrealistic standards and cyberbullying.\n\n**Block 1 Paragraph**\n\nOne opposing argument is that social media can create a supportive environment for individuals, particularly those who may feel isolated in their offline lives. Proponents of this view, such as mental health advocates, suggest that online communities provide a platform for users to share their experiences and receive encouragement from others facing similar challenges (Smith, 2020). They argue that these connections can enhance feelings of belonging and reduce loneliness. However, despite these potential benefits, it is essential to recognize that the negative aspects of social media often overshadow these positive effects. For instance, the constant exposure to curated and idealized representations of life can lead to feelings of inadequacy and low self-esteem among users, which can exacerbate mental health issues (Johnson, 2021).\n\n**Block 2 Paragraph**\n\nMoreover, excessive social media use can significantly contribute to mental health problems, particularly through the promotion of unrealistic standards. In today's digital age, users are frequently bombarded with images and messages that depict unattainable lifestyles and appearances. This phenomenon can lead to a distorted self-image and increased anxiety, as individuals compare themselves to these idealized portrayals. Research indicates that individuals who spend more time on social media are more likely to experience symptoms of depression and anxiety, as they struggle to measure up to the unrealistic expectations set by their peers (Williams, 2022). Consequently, the pressure to conform to these standards can create a toxic environment that negatively impacts mental well-being.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, while social media can offer some benefits in terms of community and support, the detrimental effects of excessive use on mental health cannot be overlooked. The promotion of unrealistic standards and the prevalence of cyberbullying contribute to increased anxiety and depression among users. It is imperative for individuals to be aware of these risks and to approach social media with caution, prioritizing their mental well-being above the pressures of online validation."

        "**BLOCK 1 PARAGRAPH**\n\nCritics of prioritizing environmental concerns often argue that economic growth should take precedence, as they believe that immediate financial gains are crucial for national development. Proponents of this view contend that investing in industries that drive economic growth can lead to job creation and improved living standards, which are essential for societal progress. For instance, some economists assert that the short-term benefits of fossil fuel industries, such as oil and gas, outweigh the long-term environmental costs (Smith, 2022). They argue that without a strong economy, countries may struggle to fund environmental initiatives, thus justifying the prioritization of economic growth over sustainability.\n\nHowever, it is essential to recognize that this perspective is fundamentally flawed. While economic growth is important, it should not come at the expense of environmental degradation, as the long-term consequences of climate change can undermine economic stability. Research indicates that investing in renewable energy not only mitigates climate change but also creates more jobs than fossil fuel industries (Johnson, 2023). By transitioning to sustainable practices, economies can thrive while ensuring the health of the planet for future generations, demonstrating that environmental sustainability and economic growth can coexist harmoniously.\n\n**BLOCK 2 PARAGRAPH**\n\nFurthermore, prioritizing renewable energy solutions is crucial for combating climate change effectively. Transitioning to renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions, which are the primary drivers of climate change. This shift not only helps to mitigate the adverse effects of climate change but also promotes energy independence and security. For example, a study by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) found that doubling the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix could lead to a reduction of up to 70% in carbon emissions by 2050 (IRENA, 2021). This evidence underscores the importance of adopting renewable energy as a central strategy in the fight against climate change, highlighting its potential to create a sustainable future.\n\n**CONCLUSION**\n\nIn conclusion, it is vital to prioritize sustainable practices over short-term economic growth to effectively address climate change. The argument that economic development should take precedence fails to consider the long-term consequences of environmental degradation, which can ultimately harm economies. By focusing on renewable energy solutions, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote a healthier planet. It is imperative for governments, businesses, and individuals to embrace sustainable practices, as doing so will not only benefit the environment but also ensure a prosperous future for generations to come.",
        "**Block 1 Paragraph**\n\n**Opposing Argument:** Critics of prioritizing environmental concerns often argue that economic growth is paramount for societal progress. They believe that focusing on immediate economic development can lead to job creation and improved living standards, which are essential for communities, especially in developing nations. Proponents of this view, such as certain policymakers and business leaders, assert that the costs associated with implementing sustainable practices can hinder economic advancement (Smith, 2022).\n\n**Rebuttal:** However, it is crucial to recognize that short-term economic gains can lead to long-term detrimental effects on the environment. Transitioning to renewable energy not only mitigates climate change but also fosters sustainable economic growth. For instance, investing in solar and wind energy creates jobs in new industries and reduces dependence on fossil fuels, which are subject to volatile markets (Johnson, 2023). Thus, prioritizing sustainable practices can align economic growth with environmental stewardship, ensuring a healthier planet for future generations."
