Towering skyscrapers, once symbols of prosperity, now stand as aged and worn-out giants, their surfaces cloaked in a thick layer of moss and ivy. The remnants of a once-bustling city are evident in the crumbling facades and shattered windows, whispering tales of a vibrant past now silenced by time.\n\nThe streets below are a chaotic tapestry of broken asphalt, with cracks snaking through the surface and debris scattered haphazardly, a stark reminder of neglect.
