",
        "In halls where wisdom's echoes fade, young scholars tread with care,  \nTheir dreams like fragile blossoms wilt, beneath the weight of air.  \nWith every scroll, a tale unfolds, of struggles yet untold,  \nYet in the silence, hearts grow cold, as aspirations fold.  \nThe ladder's rungs, so steep and high, seem distant, out of reach,  \nWhile shadows loom, and futures dim, they yearn for one more speech.  \nTo rise or fall, the choice remains, a burden they must bear.
