        "To calculate the total feed per day for Rasbora lateriterata fish species, we need to follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Calculate the Total Number of Fish\nGiven:\n- Density = 500 fish/m\u00b2\n- Total pond size = 2500 m\u00b2\n\nTotal number of fish = Density \u00d7 Total pond size\n\\[\n\\text{Total number of fish} = 500 \\, \\text{fish/m}^2 \\times 2500 \\, \\text{m}^2 = 1,250,000 \\, \\text{fish}\n\\]\n\n### Step 2: Calculate the Total Biomass\nEach fish weighs 20 grams. Therefore, the total biomass can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Total biomass (kg)} = \\text{Total number of fish} \\times \\text{Weight per fish (kg)}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Total biomass (kg)} = 1,250,000 \\, \\text{fish} \\times 0.020 \\, \\text{kg/fish} = 25,000 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\n### Step 3: Determine the Daily Feed Requirement\nThe feed conversion ratio (FCR) is a measure of the efficiency of feed use in fish farming. A typical FCR for fish can range from 1.0 to 2.0, depending on species, growth conditions, and feed quality. For this calculation, we will assume an FCR of 1.5, which is a reasonable estimate for many fish species.\n\nDaily feed requirement can be calculated as follows:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily feed (kg)} = \\text{Total biomass (kg)} \\times \\text{FCR}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Daily feed (kg)} = 25,000 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 1.5 = 37,500 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\n### Step 4: Calculate the Protein Value of the Feed\nThe protein requirement for optimal growth in fish can vary, but a common protein requirement for many freshwater fish species is around 30-40% of the feed. For this calculation, we will assume a protein content of 35%.\n\nTo find the total protein required per day:\n\\[\n\\text{Daily protein requirement (kg)} = \\text{Daily feed (kg)} \\times \\text{Protein percentage}\n\\]\n\\[\n\\text{Daily protein requirement (kg)} = 37,500 \\, \\text{kg} \\times 0.35 = 13,125 \\, \\text{kg}\n\\]\n\n### Summary of Results\n- **Total feed per day**: 37,500 kg\n- **Daily protein requirement**: 13,125 kg\n\nThese calculations provide a basis for feeding Rasbora lateriterata in a controlled aquaculture environment to achieve a reliable FCR.
