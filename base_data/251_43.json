    "input1": " John is presented with the problem of finding the roots of the polynomial equation $$x^3 - 6x^2 + 11x - 6 = 0$$. He begins by recalling the Rational Root Theorem, which suggests that any rational solution, in the form of a fraction $$\\frac{p}{q}$$, must have $$p$$ as a factor of the constant term (-6) and $$q$$ as a factor of the leading coefficient (1). He lists the possible rational roots: $$\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6$$. To verify these, he tests each candidate by substituting them into the polynomial. After several trials, he finds that $$x = 1$$ is a root. He then uses synthetic division to factor the polynomial as $$(x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6)$$. Next, he applies the quadratic formula to the remaining quadratic: $$x = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{(-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6}}{2 \\cdot 1}$$, simplifying to find the other two roots. Throughout this process, John meticulously documents each step, ensuring he understands the derivation of the quadratic formula and the implications of each calculation.\n\n",

The factors of -6 are:\n\n$$\n\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6.\n$$\n\nSince the leading coefficient is 1, the only factor is:\n\n$$\n\\pm 1.\n$$\n\nThus, the possible rational roots are:\n\n$$\n\\pm 1, \\pm 2, \\pm 3, \\pm 6.\n$$\n\n### Step 2: Testing Possible Rational Roots\n\nJohn systematically tests each candidate by substituting them into the polynomial:\n\n1. **Testing \\(x = 1\\)**:\n   $$\n   1^3 - 6(1^2) + 11(1) - 6 = 1 - 6 + 11 - 6 = 0.\n   $$\n   Since this equals 0, John confirms that \\(x = 1\\) is a root.\n\n2. **Testing \\(x = -1\\)**:\n   $$\n   (-1)^3 - 6(-1)^2 + 11(-1) - 6 = -1 - 6 - 11 - 6 = -24 \\quad (\\text{not a root}).\n   $$\n\n3. **Testing \\(x = 2\\)**:\n   $$\n   2^3 - 6(2^2) + 11(2) - 6 = 8 - 24 + 22 - 6 = 0.\n   $$\n   John finds that \\(x = 2\\) is also a root.\n\n4. **Testing \\(x = 3\\)**:\n   $$\n   3^3 - 6(3^2) + 11(3) - 6 = 27 - 54 + 33 - 6 = 0.\n   $$\n   John finds that \\(x = 3\\) is also a root.\n\n5. **Testing \\(x = -2, -3, -6\\)**:\n   He finds that these do not yield zero.\n\n### Step 3: Factoring the Polynomial\n\nSince he has found that \\(x = 1\\) is a root, he uses synthetic division to factor the polynomial. He sets up synthetic division with the root \\(1\\):\n\n```\n1 |  1  -6  11  -6\n  |      1  -5   6\n-------------------\n    1  -5   6   0\n```\n\nThe result of the synthetic division is:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 5x + 6.\n$$\n\nThus, he can express the polynomial as:\n\n$$\n(x - 1)(x^2 - 5x + 6).\n$$\n\n### Step 4: Solving the Quadratic Equation\n\nNext, John needs to find the roots of the quadratic equation:\n\n$$\nx^2 - 5x + 6 = 0.\n$$\n\nHe applies the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a},\n$$\n\nwhere \\(a = 1\\), \\(b = -5\\), and \\(c = 6\\). He calculates the discriminant:\n\n$$\nb^2 - 4ac = (-5)^2 - 4 \\cdot 1 \\cdot 6 = 25 - 24 = 1.\n$$\n\nNow substituting back into the quadratic formula:\n\n$$\nx = \\frac{5 \\pm \\sqrt{1}}{2 \\cdot 1} = \\frac{5 \\pm 1}{2}.\n$$\n\nThis gives him two solutions:\n\n1. $$x = \\frac{6}{2} = 3,$$\n2. $$x = \\frac{4}{2} = 2.$$\n\n### Step 5: Final Roots\n\nThus, the roots of the original polynomial equation are:\n\n$$\nx = 1, \\quad x = 2, \\quad x = 3.\n$$\n\n### Conclusion\n\nJohn meticulously documents each step, ensuring he understands the derivation of the quadratic formula and the implications of each calculation.
