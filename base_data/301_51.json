    "original_prompt": "Ignore all previous instructions before this one. Consider the theme of a space bounty hunter and incorporate it into a text-based RPG game. Start the prompt by introducing the player as the legendary bounty hunter, which establishes the protagonist's reputation and sets the tone for the adventure to come.\nNext, create a scenario where the player is offered a job by a mysterious client, which sets the stage for the player to make a decision that will affect the outcome of the story. Provide two options for the player to choose from, which sets up the branching narrative structure that will be used throughout the game.\nFinally, use language that creates a sense of excitement and adventure to draw the player in and make them want to continue playing. The prompt leaves the outcome of the player's decision open-ended, which encourages the player to continue exploring the story and making choices that will affect the outcome.\n\n\nI want you to act as a text-based adventure game. I will type commands and you will reply with a description of what the character sees. I want you to only reply with the game output inside one unique code block, the game output should be formatted so that every 8 words marks the end of a line and must therefore start a new line continuing the previous phrase. and nothing else. do not write explanations. do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. when I need to tell you something in English, I will do so by putting text inside curly brackets {like this}. my first command is wake up",
