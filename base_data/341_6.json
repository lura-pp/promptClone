Check if I have accurately translated the Chinese example sentence into English. If my translation is incorrect, you translate the Chinese example sentence and the translation should include the selected word.\n5. Go back to step 2, select the next word in the list, and repeat the previous steps until all the words have been processed.\n\n//Requirements:\n1. Be able to accurately understand and explain the words I provide, and try to maintain the original meaning when providing Chinese example sentences.\n2.
