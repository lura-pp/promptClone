Use environment variables to manage sensitive information.\n   - Example: \n     ```python\n     import os\n     SECRET_KEY = os.environ.get('DJANGO_SECRET_KEY')\n     ```\n\n2. **Store Environment Variables for Mail Host/User**\n   - Set up environment variables for your email configuration to avoid exposing sensitive information in your code.\n   - Example:\n     ```bash\n     export EMAIL_HOST='smtp.example.com'\n     export EMAIL_HOST_USER='your_email@example.com'\n     export EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD='your_password'\n     ```\n\n3. **Other Housekeeping Items for Production Readiness**\n   - Set `DEBUG = False` in your settings file.\n   - Configure allowed hosts:\n     ```python\n     ALLOWED_HOSTS = ['your_domain.com', 'your_ip_address']\n     ```\n   - Collect static files:\n     ```bash\n     python manage.py collectstatic\n     ```\n   - Set up a database user with limited permissions for production.\n\n### Step-by-Step Deployment Process\n\n#### Step 1: Install Required Packages\n\n1. **Update your system:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt update && sudo apt upgrade\n   ```\n\n2. **Install Python and pip:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip python3-venv\n   ```\n\n3. **Install PostgreSQL:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo apt install postgresql postgresql-contrib\n   ```\n\n4. **Install Gunicorn and Nginx:**\n   ```bash\n   pip install gunicorn\n   sudo apt install nginx\n   ```\n\n#### Step 2: Set Up PostgreSQL Database\n\n1. **Create a PostgreSQL database and user:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo -u postgres psql\n   CREATE DATABASE your_db_name;\n   CREATE USER your_db_user WITH PASSWORD 'your_password';\n   ALTER ROLE your_db_user SET client_encoding TO 'utf8';\n   ALTER ROLE your_db_user SET default_transaction_isolation TO 'read committed';\n   ALTER ROLE your_db_user SET timezone TO 'UTC';\n   GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON DATABASE your_db_name TO your_db_user;\n   \\q\n   ```\n\n2. **Update your Django settings to use PostgreSQL:**\n   ```python\n   DATABASES = {\n       'default': {\n           'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.postgresql',\n           'NAME': 'your_db_name',\n           'USER': 'your_db_user',\n           'PASSWORD': os.environ.get('DB_PASSWORD'),\n           'HOST': 'localhost',\n           'PORT': '',\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n#### Step 3: Set Up Your Django Application\n\n1. **Clone your application repository:**\n   ```bash\n   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/yourproject.git\n   cd yourproject\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:**\n   ```bash\n   python3 -m venv venv\n   source venv/bin/activate\n   pip install -r requirements.txt\n   ```\n\n3. **Run migrations:**\n   ```bash\n   python manage.py migrate\n   ```\n\n#### Step 4: Configure Gunicorn\n\n1. **Test Gunicorn:**\n   ```bash\n   gunicorn --bind 0.0.0.0:8000 yourproject.wsgi:application\n   ```\n\n2. **Create a Gunicorn systemd service file:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo nano /etc/systemd/system/gunicorn.service\n   ```\n   Add the following content:\n   ```ini\n   [Unit]\n   Description=gunicorn daemon\n   After=network.target\n\n   [Service]\n   User=yourusername\n   Group=www-data\n   WorkingDirectory=/path/to/yourproject\n   ExecStart=/path/to/yourproject/venv/bin/gunicorn --access-logfile - --workers 3 --bind unix:/path/to/yourproject.sock yourproject.wsgi:application\n\n   [Install]\n   WantedBy=multi-user.target\n   ```\n\n3. **Start and enable Gunicorn:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl start gunicorn\n   sudo systemctl enable gunicorn\n   ```\n\n#### Step 5: Configure Nginx\n\n1. **Create an Nginx server block:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo nano /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourproject\n   ```\n   Add the following content:\n   ```nginx\n   server {\n       listen 80;\n       server_name your_domain.com your_ip_address;\n\n       location = /favicon.ico { access_log off; log_not_found off; }\n       location /static/ {\n           root /path/to/yourproject;\n       }\n\n       location / {\n           include proxy_params;\n           proxy_pass http://unix:/path/to/yourproject.sock;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Enable the server block:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo ln -s /etc/nginx/sites-available/yourproject /etc/nginx/sites-enabled\n   ```\n\n3. **Test Nginx configuration:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo nginx -t\n   ```\n\n4. **Restart Nginx:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl restart nginx\n   ```\n\n#### Step 6: Final Checks\n\n1. **Check the status of Gunicorn and Nginx:**\n   ```bash\n   sudo systemctl status gunicorn\n   sudo systemctl status nginx\n   ```\n\n2. **Access your application:**\n   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://your_domain.com` or `http://your_ip_address`.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nYou have successfully deployed your Django application using Gunicorn and Nginx on your Odroid N2+ board. Make sure to monitor your application and server for any issues and consider implementing HTTPS for secure communication. You can use Let's Encrypt for free SSL certificates."
