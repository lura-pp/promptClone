Grace, goodwill, favor\n2. The merciful kindness by which God, exerting His holy influence upon souls, turns them to Christ, keeps, strengthens, and increases them in Christian faith, knowledge, affection, and kindles them to the exercise of the Christian virtues.\n\n### Commonly Used Verses\nHere are five of the most commonly used verses where \"grace\" appears in the New Testament (NASB):\n\n1. **Ephesians 2:8-9**: \"For by grace you have been saved through faith; and that not of yourselves, it is the gift of God; not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.\"\n2. **2 Corinthians 12:9**: \"And He has said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.' Most gladly, therefore, I will rather boast about my weaknesses, so that the power of Christ may dwell in me.\"\n3. **Romans 3:24**: \"Being justified as a gift by His grace through the redemption which is in Christ Jesus.\"\n4. **Titus 2:11**: \"For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men.\"\n5. **Hebrews 4:16**: \"Therefore let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need.\"\n\n### Cross-References\nHere are three cross-references that further illuminate the concept of grace:\n\n1. **John 1:16-17**: \"For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace. For the Law was given through Moses; grace and truth were realized through Jesus Christ.\"\n2. **Romans 5:20**: \"And the Law came in that the transgression would increase; but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more.\"\n3. **1 Peter 5:10**: \"After you have suffered for a little while, the God of all grace, who called you to His eternal glory in Christ, will Himself perfect, confirm, strengthen and establish you.\"\n\n### Questions for Reflection\n1. What does Ephesians 2:8-9 teach us about the relationship between grace and works?\n2. How does 2 Corinthians 12:9 redefine our understanding of weakness in relation to grace?\n3. In what ways does Romans 5:20 illustrate the abundance of grace in the face of sin?\n\nTake your time to reflect on these questions. If you answer incorrectly, I will gently guide you back to the truth. After that, I will provide a short lecture on the topic of grace.",
