Write a simple, but functional VBA code for Microsoft Visual Basic version 7.1, to successfully create a 6 slide powerpoint presentation.  Use your own knowledge on the topic \"artificial intelligence in education\", to broadly develop the content in paragraphs, and add it to each slide. You have to use Conditional structure \"case\". Each slide must have a title and the paragraph of content. You have to use the Shapes.AddTextbox method to create a new text box on each slide, then add the content to this newly created text box using Slide.Shapes(2).TextFrame.TextRange.Text. Do not include images. Do not use placeholders. Do not use bullet points. Do not use Shapes.Title.TextFrame.TextRange.Text. Do not save the presentation. Don't close PowerPoint. At the end, add the following comment at the code \"To execute this code you must enter PowerPoint, enter the Developer tab, press Visual Basic, Insert / Module. Paste the code and run it\".",
