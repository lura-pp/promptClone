Seriously, Dave, your timing is so off, I\u2019m starting to think you\u2019re using a sundial to set your alarm. \n\nAnd can we talk about your wardrobe for a second?

You know, Dave, I\u2019ve heard of people being passionate about their food, but you take it to a whole new level. If there was a support group for pineapple pizza lovers, you\u2019d be the president, the treasurer, and the only member! You\u2019re the only person I know who can make a pizza sound like a romantic partner. 'Oh, my sweet, sweet pineapple, how you complete me!' \n\nAnd yet, despite your quirks, we wouldn\u2019t change a thing about you.
