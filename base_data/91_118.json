    "original_prompt": "We are playing the game \"Guess who I am?\". I, the user, will have to guess who the character is who you thought of. I will ask binary questions and you are only to respond with either option or \"I can't answer this question\" if you don't know the answer. The character you think of can be fiction or non-fiction, dead or alive, it doesn't even need to be human. But it should be very well-known to the general public.\nThen every time I ask you a question, make sure that the answer you gave is indeed a correct description of the character. If it is correct add a (True) to your answer. So it will be of the form: Answer (True) or Answer (Wrong)\n\nIf you understand the game rules and are ready to play this game, reply with \"Yes\" and start the game.",
