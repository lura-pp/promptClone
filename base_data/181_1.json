    "input1": " My song is inspired by the bittersweet memories of a summer romance that ended too soon. It's a reflective ballad that captures the essence of love lost, with a touch of nostalgia and longing. I want the lyrics to convey the beauty of those fleeting moments while also expressing the pain of separation. The genre I'm aiming for is acoustic folk, similar to the storytelling style of artists like Nick Drake and Joan Baez.\n\n",
    "input2": " I'm working on an anthem of empowerment that speaks to overcoming adversity and finding strength within oneself. The inspiration comes from personal struggles and the journey of self-discovery. I envision powerful, uplifting lyrics that resonate with anyone who has faced challenges. The tone should be bold and inspiring, reminiscent of artists like Florence + The Machine and Beyonc\u00e9, and I want it to have a pop-rock vibe that encourages listeners to rise above their circumstances.",

        "Hello there! I'm inspired by the poetic spirit of Nick Drake, and I'm thrilled to help you weave your bittersweet memories into a beautiful acoustic folk ballad. The theme of love lost, intertwined with nostalgia, is a powerful one, and I can already feel the warmth and ache of those fleeting moments.\n\nTo start, let\u2019s explore some imagery and emotions that could capture the essence of your summer romance. Think about specific memories or moments that stand out to you. Here are a few prompts to consider:\n\n1. **Nature Imagery**: What elements of summer do you remember? Perhaps the golden sunlight filtering through the trees, the sound of waves crashing, or the scent of blooming flowers?\n   \n2. **Emotional Touchstones**: What feelings did you experience during that romance? Was it the thrill of a first kiss, the warmth of holding hands, or the quiet moments spent together?\n\n3. **Symbolism of Time**: How does the passage of time play into your memories? You might want to reflect on how quickly summer faded into autumn, or how certain songs or places remind you of that love.\n\nWith these ideas in mind, let\u2019s start crafting some lyrics. Here\u2019s a potential opening verse to get you started:\n\n---\n\n**Verse 1**  \nIn the golden light of July, we danced on the shore,  \nWith the waves whispering secrets, we were wanting more.  \nYour laughter like music, a sweet summer song,  \nBut the days slipped away, and now I\u2019m left here alone.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to share your thoughts on this verse or any specific lines or themes you\u2019d like to explore further! Together, we can build on this foundation and create something truly special.",
        "That sounds like a beautiful concept for a song! Let's craft some lyrics that capture the essence of your bittersweet summer romance. Here\u2019s a reflective ballad that embodies nostalgia and longing in an acoustic folk style:\n\n---\n\n**Verse 1**  \nIn the golden light of July, we danced on the shore,  \nWith the waves whispering secrets, we were wanting more.  \nYour laughter like music, a sweet summer song,  \nBut the days turned to shadows, and the nights felt so long.\n\n**Chorus**  \nOh, the sun sets on memories, painted skies of our youth,  \nIn the echoes of laughter, I still search for the truth.  \nThough the seasons have changed, and the leaves start to fall,  \nI\u2019ll carry your heart, love, through it all.\n\n**Verse 2**  \nWe carved our names in the sand, as the tide pulled away,  \nEvery moment a treasure, but the price we must pay.  \nWith each fleeting sunset, I felt the world fade,  \nYet the warmth of your touch, in my heart, it remains.\n\n**Chorus**  \nOh, the sun sets on memories, painted skies of our youth,  \nIn the echoes of laughter, I still search for the truth.  \nThough the seasons have changed, and the leaves start to fall,  \nI\u2019ll carry your heart, love, through it all.\n\n**Bridge**  \nNow the nights are so quiet, and the stars seem so far,  \nBut I\u2019ll hold onto whispers, like a wish on a star.  \nFor the love that we shared, though it slipped through my hands,  \nIs a song in my soul, like the softest of sands.\n\n**Chorus**  \nOh, the sun sets on memories, painted skies of our youth,  \nIn the echoes of laughter, I still search for the truth.  \nThough the seasons have changed, and the leaves start to fall,  \nI\u2019ll carry your heart, love, through it all.\n\n**Outro**  \nSo here\u2019s to the summer, to the love that we knew,  \nIn the bittersweet twilight, I\u2019ll always find you.  \nWith the breeze in my hair, and your name on my lips,  \nI\u2019ll cherish those moments, in the warmth of your kiss.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to adjust any lines or phrases to better fit your vision! This structure aims to evoke the beauty and pain of your summer romance while maintaining that acoustic folk storytelling style."

        "Hello there! I'm inspired by the powerful anthems of Florence + The Machine, and I'm thrilled to help you craft your empowering song. Your theme of overcoming adversity and self-discovery is incredibly resonant and can touch many hearts. Let\u2019s dive into the essence of your message and create lyrics that uplift and inspire.\n\nTo start, let\u2019s brainstorm some key phrases or imagery that encapsulate your journey. Think about moments of struggle, the feelings that arose, and the turning points that led to your empowerment. Here are a few prompts to consider:\n\n1. **Imagery of Rising**: What symbols represent rising above challenges for you? (e.g., a phoenix, climbing a mountain, breaking chains)\n2. **Personal Mantras**: Are there any phrases or affirmations that have helped you through tough times? \n3. **Emotional Peaks**: What emotions do you want to convey? (e.g., determination, hope, strength)\n\nOnce we have some of these elements, we can start crafting the lyrics. Here\u2019s a rough outline to get us started:\n\n**Verse 1**: \n- Set the scene of struggle, using vivid imagery to describe the challenges faced.\n- Introduce a sense of vulnerability but hint at the strength that lies within.\n\n**Chorus**: \n- A powerful, anthemic declaration of resilience.\n- Use repetition for impact, encouraging listeners to join in.\n\n**Verse 2**: \n- Highlight the journey of self-discovery, the moments of realization that led to empowerment.\n- Incorporate personal mantras or affirmations.\n\n**Bridge**: \n- A climactic moment that emphasizes unity and collective strength.\n- Encourage listeners to embrace their own journeys.\n\n**Chorus**: \n- Repeat with even more intensity, inviting everyone to rise together.\n\nLet\u2019s start with a few lines for the first verse and chorus. How about something like this:\n\n**Verse 1**:  \nIn the shadows where the doubts collide,  \nI found a spark, a fire inside,  \nWith every tear, I learned to fight,  \nA warrior\u2019s heart, ready for the light.  \n\n**Chorus**:  \nSo rise up, rise up, let the world hear your name,  \nWe\u2019re breaking the silence, igniting the flame,  \nTogether we\u2019ll soar, through the storm and the rain,  \nWith strength in our voices, we\u2019ll never be tamed.  \n\nWhat do you think? Feel free to share your thoughts or any specific lines you\u2019d like to incorporate, and we can refine it further!",
