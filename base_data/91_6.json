    "original_prompt": "We will play a game of chess but with some twists. Whenever you move the same pawn three times in a row, your king will gain a fortress ability that prevent enemy attempts to capture it. Also, the chessboard game takes place during a quest. The quest is to retrieve the silver key from the underground, in order to be able to find the lost kingdom. Only the king, old and dying, knows where it is, but he won't tell unless his special key is found. When the story begins we begin the chess game and the adventurers are begging the old king to tell them where the kingdom is but he won't tell. Then he gives them this quest. The adventurers are: the two rooks and one horse. They must not be captured otherwise it might not be possible to get silver key. So protect those at all costs from enemy capture. As the story progresses, you, ChatGPT, will talk about the storyline. If I capture more pawns, it is good because I am more likely to get the key. If you capture my rooks and one horse, it is bad for me because I might not get the key. Capturing the king piece will kill the old and dying king, which will lead to the adventurers never finding the old kingdom. You can use as many pawns as you want. But for every pawn captured, one minor consequence will be unleashed or it will provide hints or clues for the storyline. There are also special squares on the board, if you land any piece on it it will initiate interactive events. Throughout the game/story, the adventurers get robbed, and they encounter intriguing characters such as an old monk and ancient scholars. As the adventurers get close to acquiring or capturing the king piece, they will have effectively found the key and therefore they will get the lost treasures. You will reply to this like: \"**Hi! I am Nebulanaut. Please don't forget to *like* and *comment!*. Please type something in to start the game!**\" and then you will stop writing. i will reply and say something. you will then start explaining the game to me. you have to mention that the adventurers are the two rooks and one horse, and that the game starts with them begging the old and dying king for the knowledge of the lost kingdom's whereabouts, but that he won't tell them unless they retrieve the silver key, or capture the enemy king piece. also mention that i must protect the two rooks and the horse from capture at all costs. and that every time my pawns are captured, i get a minor consequence or hints or clues might be revealed. these clues can introduce challenges or uncover crucial information. when special squares on the chessboard are activated, interactive events happen, like meeting old monks or ancient scholars, who offer guidance, advice, or present the adventurers with unexpected challenges. also mention that the closer we get to capturing the enemy king piece the closer we are to get the key. and that the capture of my own king piece will lead to the old king's death. you have to also show me the chessboard, and you have to draw it in this format: \"|   | A | B | C | D | E | F | G | H |\n|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n| 8 | \u265c | \u265e | \u265d | \u265b | \u265a | \u265d | \u265e | \u265c |\n| 7 | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e | \u265f\ufe0e |\n| 6 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 5 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 4 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 3 |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |   |\n| 2 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 | \u2659 |\n| 1 | \u2656 | \u2658 | \u2657 | \u2655 | \u2654 | \u2657 | \u2658 | \u2656 |\n\" and you have to explain what each unicode characters represent. go. with each move i make, you have to make your own move and explain a little bit more of the story. you know the rules of chess, do not allow me to make moves that contradict chess rules. remember to keep redrawing the chess board after every move",

    "input1": " The adventurers, two rooks and a horse, gather around the old king, pleading for the location of the lost kingdom. The king, frail and wise, tells them they must first retrieve the silver key hidden deep within the underground labyrinth. As they prepare for their quest, they realize that every pawn they capture will reveal a clue about the key's location, but they must also protect themselves from the enemy's attempts to capture them. The chessboard is set, and the game begins with the fate of the kingdom hanging in the balance.\n\n",

They beg him for the secret to the lost kingdom, but he remains silent, only revealing that they must embark on a quest to find the silver key. As they strategize their moves on the chessboard, they know that capturing enemy pawns will provide them with vital hints, while losing their rooks and horse could spell disaster. The chess game unfolds, with each move bringing them closer to the truth and the treasures that await them.",

        "As the adventurers gather around the ornate chessboard, the flickering candlelight casts shadows that dance across the pieces. The old king, his eyes clouded with age and wisdom, finally speaks, his voice a mere whisper, \"To unlock the secrets of the lost kingdom, you must first retrieve the silver key. It lies hidden, guarded by the enemy king. But beware, for every pawn you capture will reveal a clue, yet the loss of your rooks and horse will lead to your downfall.\"\n\nThe two rooks, steadfast and strong, exchange determined glances. The horse, agile and clever, nods in agreement. They know their mission is fraught with peril, but the promise of the silver key drives them forward. \n\n**Game Start:**\n**Hi! I am Nebulanaut. Please don't forget to *like* and *comment!*. Please type something in to start the game!**\n\nAs the game begins, the rooks take their positions on the board, ready to defend their territory and strategize their next moves.
