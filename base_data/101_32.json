        "### What is an Algorithm?\n\nAn algorithm is a step-by-step procedure or formula for solving a problem. It is a set of instructions that can be followed to achieve a specific goal or to perform a task. Algorithms are fundamental to computer science and programming, as they provide a clear method for processing data and solving problems.\n\n### Example 1: Bubble Sort\n\nBubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The process is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n#### Bubble Sort Code Example\n\n```python\ndef bubble_sort(arr):\n    n = len(arr)\n    for i in range(n):\n        # Track if a swap was made\n        swapped = False\n        for j in range(0, n-i-1):\n            if arr[j] > arr[j+1]:\n                arr[j], arr[j+1] = arr[j+1], arr[j]  # Swap\n                swapped = True\n        if not swapped:\n            break  # Stop if the array is already sorted\n    return arr\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_arr = bubble_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n#### Bubble Sort Visualization\n\nHere's a simple ASCII art visualization of how Bubble Sort works:\n\n```\nInitial array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n\nPass 1:\n[64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] -> [34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n[34, 64, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90] -> [34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n[34, 25, 64, 12, 22, 11, 90] -> [34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11, 90]\n[34, 25, 12, 64, 22, 11, 90] -> [34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11, 90]\n[34, 25, 12, 22, 64, 11, 90] -> [34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]\n[34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90] -> [25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90]\n\nPass 2:\n[25, 34, 12, 22, 11, 64, 90] -> [25, 12, 34, 22, 11, 64, 90]\n[25, 12, 34, 22, 11, 64, 90] -> [12, 25, 34, 22, 11, 64, 90]\n[12, 25, 34, 22, 11, 64, 90] -> [12, 25, 22, 34, 11, 64, 90]\n[12, 25, 22, 34, 11, 64, 90] -> [12, 22, 25, 34, 11, 64, 90]\n[12, 22, 25, 34, 11, 64, 90] -> [12, 22, 25, 11, 34, 64, 90]\n\nPass 3:\n[12, 22, 25, 11, 34, 64, 90] -> [12, 22, 11, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n[12, 22, 11, 25, 34, 64, 90] -> [12, 11, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n[12, 11, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90] -> [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n\nFinal sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\n### Example 2: Quick Sort\n\nQuick Sort is a more efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It selects a 'pivot' element from the array and partitions the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot. The sub-arrays are then sorted recursively.\n\n#### Quick Sort Code Example\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]  # Choose the pivot\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]  # Elements less than pivot\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]  # Elements equal to pivot\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]  # Elements greater than pivot\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\n# Example usage\narr = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\nsorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)\nprint(\"Sorted array:\", sorted_arr)\n```\n\n#### Quick Sort Visualization\n\nHere's a simple ASCII art visualization of how Quick Sort works:\n\n```\nInitial array: [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]\n\nChoose pivot: 22\n\nPartitioning:\nLeft:  [12, 11]  |  Pivot: [22]  |  Right: [64, 34, 25, 90]\n\nRecursively sort left and right:\nLeft: [12, 11] -> [11, 12]\nRight: [64, 34, 25, 90] with pivot 34\nLeft: [25] | Pivot: [34] | Right: [64, 90]\n\nFinal sorted array: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]\n```\n\nFeel free to ask any additional questions or for further clarifications!",

The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.\n\n#### Visualization of Bubble Sort\n\nLet's visualize how Bubble Sort works with an example list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.\n\n1. **Initial List**:  \n   ```\n   [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]\n   ```\n\n2. **First Pass**:  \n   - Compare 5 and 3 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`\n   - Compare 5 and 8 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 5, 8, 4, 2]`\n   - Compare 8 and 4 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 5, 4, 8, 2]`\n   - Compare 8 and 2 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`\n\n3. **Second Pass**:  \n   - Compare 3 and 5 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 5, 4, 2, 8]`\n   - Compare 5 and 4 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 4, 5, 2, 8]`\n   - Compare 5 and 2 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 5 and 8 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n\n4. **Third Pass**:  \n   - Compare 3 and 4 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 4, 2, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 4 and 2 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 4 and 5 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 5 and 8 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[3, 2, 4, 5, 8]`\n\n5. **Fourth Pass**:  \n   - Compare 3 and 2 \u2192 Swap \u2192 `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 3 and 4 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 4 and 5 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`\n   - Compare 5 and 8 \u2192 No Swap \u2192 `[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]`\n\n6. **Sorted List**:  \n   ```\n   [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n   ```\n\n### Example 2: Quick Sort\n\n**Quick Sort** is a more efficient sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer approach. It works by selecting a 'pivot' element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two sub-arrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.\n\n#### Visualization of Quick Sort\n\nLet's visualize Quick Sort with the same example list: `[5, 3, 8, 4, 2]`.\n\n1. **Initial List**:  \n   ```\n   [5, 3, 8, 4, 2]\n   ```\n\n2. **Choose Pivot**: Let's choose `5` as the pivot.\n\n3. **Partitioning**:  \n   - Elements less than 5: `[3, 4, 2]`\n   - Elements greater than 5: `[8]`\n   - Pivot: `5`\n\n   Resulting in:  \n   ```\n   [3, 4, 2, 5, 8]\n   ```\n\n4. **Recursively Apply Quick Sort**:  \n   - Sort the left sub-array `[3, 4, 2]`:\n     - Choose `3` as pivot.\n     - Partition: `[2]` (less than 3) and `[4]` (greater than 3).\n     - Result: `[2, 3, 4]`\n\n5. **Combine**:  \n   - Combine the sorted left sub-array, pivot, and sorted right sub-array:\n   ```\n   [2, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n   ```\n\n### Final Sorted List:  \n```\n[2, 3, 4, 5, 8]\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth Bubble Sort and Quick Sort are fundamental algorithms used for sorting data.
