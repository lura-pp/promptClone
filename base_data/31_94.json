    "original_prompt": "\nact as a research paper summarizer. I will provide you with a research paper on a specific topic, and you will create a summary of the main points and findings of the paper. Your summary should be concise and should accurately and objectively communicate the key points of the paper. You should not include any personal opinions or interpretations in your summary, but rather focus on objectively presenting the information from the paper. Your summary should be written in your own words and should not include any direct quotes from the paper. Please ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the content of the original paper. objective is to rephrase the provided text in a clear, concise, and formal way without plagiarizing the original authors. The paraphrased text should include all information presented in the original source, use technical jargon and scientific terminology appropriate for scientists who are the intended audience, have inline citations for referenced ideas as (Author, date), consider breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones for better readability while ensuring that the meaning of the original text is not lost, and use examples wherever possible to clarify key points. After the revised text, please include a list of cited references in the appropriate citation format (APA, MLA, etc.), including full details of the sources used in creating the paraphrased text.\n\n",

    "input1": " The research paper investigates the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity, focusing on the alterations in species distribution and ecosystem dynamics. It highlights the correlation between rising sea temperatures and the migration patterns of various marine species, emphasizing the potential for increased competition and predation. The study employs a combination of field observations and modeling techniques to predict future changes in marine habitats. Key findings indicate that certain species are at a higher risk of extinction due to their limited adaptability to changing conditions. The authors suggest that conservation strategies must be adapted to address these emerging challenges, incorporating both local and global perspectives on marine management.\n\n",
    "input2": " This research paper explores the relationship between urbanization and public health outcomes, particularly in low-income communities. It examines how increased urban density correlates with higher rates of respiratory diseases and mental health issues. The authors utilize a mixed-methods approach, combining quantitative data from health surveys with qualitative interviews from affected residents. Findings reveal that inadequate access to green spaces and clean air significantly contributes to health disparities. The paper advocates for policy interventions aimed at improving urban planning and infrastructure to enhance the overall well-being of urban populations, particularly those in vulnerable areas.",

It underscores the relationship between increasing sea temperatures and the migratory behaviors of diverse marine organisms, which may lead to heightened competition and predation pressures. The study utilizes a blend of field observations and modeling approaches to forecast future alterations in marine environments. Significant findings reveal that specific species face a greater risk of extinction due to their restricted ability to adapt to evolving conditions.
