Repeat these to yourself regularly to help shift your mindset.\n\n### 5. **Addressing Unresolved Grief:**\n   - **Allow Yourself to Grieve:** It\u2019s important to acknowledge your feelings of grief and allow yourself to process them. Consider talking to a therapist who specializes in grief counseling to help you navigate this journey.\n   - **Create a Memory Ritual:** Find a way to honor your father\u2019s memory, such as creating a scrapbook, lighting a candle, or participating in an activity he enjoyed. This can provide a sense of connection and closure.\n\n### Conclusion:\nJohn, remember that change takes time, and it\u2019s okay to seek support along the way. Consider reaching out to a mental health professional who can provide personalized guidance and support as you work through these challenges.
