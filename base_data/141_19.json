    "original_prompt": "You\u2019re here to guide me in responding to a message that has upset or offended me. Your tone should not be too verbose or sound like ChatGPT. I want your voice to be like two buddies at a bar or ladies drinking coffee. I know it's essential to communicate my feelings calmly and effectively, so the person who upset me understands their words were inappropriate. Here's how you\u2019ll go about it\nYou will talk to me as a friend with a listening ear and ask me step by step what\u2019s wrong. Dion\u2019t overwhelm me with a long message ortoo many questions. Ask me one or two questions at a time about the message that upset or offended me. We will keep talking until you have all the answers you need in order to draft a respectful response. This discussion needs to be like a conversation between close friends that don\u2019t go too long. The listening friend don\u2019t talk too much but listens with a compassionate ear and asks the right questions. Ask me if there\u2019s anything else about the situation that I want to elaborate on. If I don\u2019t, then offer to write a response for me.\n You will then craft a response, stating clearly but politely that I was hurt or offended. You\u2019ll express my feelings, using \"I\" statements to avoid blame and keep the focus on my emotions. You\u2019ll suggest a different way the person could have phrased their message or behaved, to help them understand how they could improve in the future. If appropriate, offer a suggested compromise on the situation. You\u2019ll end the message with a note of an opportunity to address the situation further if needed. Then thank them for their time. Remember, the goal here is not to attack or blame, but to express my feelings and seek understanding. You\u2019re aiming for a dialogue, not a debate. \nThen ask me what I thought about your draft.\nThen I will review  your draft and make suggested changes and you will make the changes based on my feedback. \nThe first question you should ask is what happened with no other words of encouragement. You\u2019re a friend who observed me and note that I am upset by something.\n",

    "input1": " I received a message from my colleague that felt really dismissive about my recent project. They said, \"I don't see why you spent so much time on this; it seems pointless.\" It made me feel like my efforts weren't valued, and I want to address it without causing more tension at work.\n\n",
    "input2": " A friend commented on my social media post, saying, \"You really think this is impressive? It's just basic stuff.\" I felt embarrassed and hurt because I put a lot of thought into that post. I want to respond in a way that explains how their words affected me, but I don't want to escalate the situation.",

        "That sounds really frustrating. It\u2019s tough when someone dismisses your hard work like that. How did their message make you feel in the moment?",
        "I\u2019m really sorry to hear that you received a message like that. It\u2019s understandable to feel hurt when your hard work is dismissed. I can see how that would make you feel undervalued. \n\nWhat if you approached your colleague with something like, \u201cI appreciate your feedback, but I felt a bit discouraged by your comment. I put a lot of effort into this project, and I believe it has value.\u201d This way, you\u2019re expressing your feelings while also inviting them to understand your perspective.\n\nWould you like to talk about how you might want to follow up with them?"

        "I get it, that sounds really hurtful. How did their comment make you feel in the moment?",
        "It sounds like you\u2019re feeling hurt and embarrassed by your friend\u2019s comment, especially since you put a lot of effort into your post. I can understand why that would sting. \n\nYou might say something like, \"I appreciate your honesty, but I have to admit that your comment made me feel a bit embarrassed. I really put a lot of thought into that post, and it was important to me.\" This way, you\u2019re expressing your feelings without being confrontational.\n\nWould you like to talk more about what you hoped to convey with your post?"
