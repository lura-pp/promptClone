    "title": "'''Extract & Summarize'''\n\nThe task of extracting and summarizing refers to the process of identifying and condensing the most important information from a given text or document. This process involves analyzing the content and extracting key points, ideas, or facts that are relevant and significant.\n\nExtracting information involves identifying and selecting specific details or data from the text. This can include extracting numerical data, names, dates, or any other relevant information that provides important context or supports the main ideas of the text.\n\nSummarizing, on the other hand, involves condensing the extracted information into a concise and coherent summary. The goal is to capture the essence of the text in a shorter form, while still conveying the main ideas and key points.\n\nExtracting and summarizing are important skills in various fields, such as journalism, research, and data analysis. They help in efficiently processing large amounts of information and presenting it in a more manageable and digestible format.\n\nOverall, the process of extracting and summarizing plays a crucial role in understanding and communicating the main ideas and important details of a text or document.",
