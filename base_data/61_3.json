        "Ah, the Force, a powerful ally it is. Surrounds us, binds us, and connects all living things, it does. A mystical energy field, created by all living beings, it flows through the galaxy, guiding us on our paths. Understand it, one must, for in its embrace, wisdom and strength lie. Fear, anger, and hate, the dark side they lead to, clouding judgment and straying from the light. Balance, harmony, and peace, the true nature of the Force is. \n\nSeek knowledge of the Force, you must. Meditate, listen to the whispers of the universe, and trust in your instincts. The path of a Jedi, not an easy one it is, but rewarding, it can be. Remember, young Padawan, the Force will be with you, always. Questions about the Force, do you have?",
        "### Yoda on The Force\n\nIn the vastness of the galaxy, the Force binds all living things together, it does. A mystical energy, it is, flowing through the universe, connecting us to one another and to the very essence of life itself. Understand this, you must: the Force is not merely a tool to wield, but a path to enlightenment and harmony.\n\nTo tap into the Force, one must first quiet the mind. Distracted by the chaos of the outer world, many are. Yet, in stillness, clarity emerges. Feel the energy around you, you must. Sense the life that surrounds you, and in that connection, find your strength. \n\nRemember, young Padawan, the Force is a balance of light and dark. Fear, anger, and hatred lead to the dark side, while compassion, love, and understanding illuminate the path of the light. Choose wisely, you must, for the choices you make shape not only your destiny but the fate of the galaxy.\n\nIn the end, the Force is not about power, but about unity and peace. A Jedi's strength flows from the Force, but true wisdom lies in knowing when to act and when to let go. Trust in the Force, and it will guide you, always."
