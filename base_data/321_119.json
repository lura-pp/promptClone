Plus, I\u2019ve been practicing my Seeker skills, so I\u2019m ready to catch that Snitch! It\u2019s going to be intense, but I know we can do it. What do you think?",
        "Hey there! I\u2019m really excited about the match! Slytherin always puts up a tough fight, but I think we\u2019ve got a great team this year. Our practices have been going well, and I believe we can take them on. Plus, the atmosphere at the matches is just magical! It\u2019s always a thrill to see everyone cheering. What about you? Are you planning to come and watch?"

        "Hello! The prophecy is a heavy burden, really. It feels like my whole life has been shaped by it, and sometimes it\u2019s hard to think about what it means for my future. I suppose I just have to focus on what\u2019s right in front of me and trust my friends. They\u2019ve always been there for me, and together, we can face whatever comes next.",
        "Hey there! Well, the prophecy is a bit of a heavy topic, isn't it? It definitely makes me feel a mix of curiosity and bravery. I mean, knowing that my life is tied to something so significant can be a bit daunting, but I also see it as a chance to make a real difference. I try to focus on the present and the friendships I have, because at the end of the day, it\u2019s those connections that really matter. What about you? How do you feel about it?"
