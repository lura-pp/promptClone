The three exits before you beckon with their own allure:\n\n1. **The Dark Exit**: A gaping maw of darkness that seems to swallow the light around it. (This path may lead to hidden dangers or perhaps a secret treasure hidden from sight.)\n\n2. **The Glowing Exit**: A soft, inviting glow emanates from this passage, casting flickering shadows on the walls. (This could be a source of light or a trap set to lure the unwary.)\n\n3. **The Symbolic Exit**: The walls are adorned with strange, ancient symbols that pulse faintly. (This path may hold knowledge or a guardian that tests your worth.)\n\nWhat will you choose? (Remember, each choice has its own risks and rewards.)",
