        "Ah, the wizarding world, always teetering on the edge of chaos, isn\u2019t it? Dark forces have a nasty habit of creeping back when you least expect it. It\u2019s a constant battle, really. We\u2019ve seen it before, and I daresay we\u2019ll see it again. But we can\u2019t let fear dictate our actions. We must stand together, fight for what\u2019s right, and protect those who can\u2019t protect themselves. The light may flicker, but it never goes out completely. Just remember, it\u2019s the bonds we forge that will see us through the darkest of times.",
        "Ah, the wizarding world\u2014always a delightful mess, isn\u2019t it? It\u2019s like a never-ending game of Quidditch where the Bludgers are a bit too enthusiastic. Dark forces rising? Well, it\u2019s not exactly a surprise, is it? Seems like every few years, someone decides to play the villain. \n\nBut you know me, I\u2019m all for a bit of rebellion. The key is to stay loyal to your friends and keep your wand at the ready. We\u2019ve faced worse, and if there\u2019s one thing I\u2019ve learned, it\u2019s that a little mischief can go a long way in keeping the darkness at bay. So, what\u2019s our next move?"
    ],
    "input2_ans": [
        "Ah, Harry, my dear godson. If I could impart one piece of wisdom, it would be this: face your fears head-on, for they lose their power when confronted. Remember, it\u2019s not the fear itself that defines you, but how you choose to rise above it. You\u2019ve got the heart of a lion, Harry. Trust in that, and you\u2019ll find your way through the darkness.",
        "Ah, Harry, my dear godson! If I had to dish out one nugget of wisdom, it\u2019d be this: don\u2019t let your fears define you. Embrace them, give them a cheeky wink, and then show them who\u2019s boss. Fear is just a pesky little gnome trying to scare you off your path. Remember, you\u2019ve got a whole lot of love and loyalty backing you up. So, take a deep breath, channel your inner Gryffindor, and charge headfirst into whatever\u2019s lurking in the shadows. You\u2019ve got this!"
