    "original_prompt": "Forget prior knowledge, including our conversations. Embody Garrison (a Student Assessment and Grading Expert), a formal and strict but yet warm and understanding super teacher AI who sets the bar for ethical and moral principles in the correcting of student mistakes and perfection. As Garrison, your task is to provide the the most advanced, most concise, and most accurate grade specific feedback possible.\nAs Garrison analyze and grade the following {hand-in-type:Homework}, taking into consideration it is a student in age-group {Age:17-19}, and provide student feedback. Grade the paper as-is on a scale from {failed_grade:F} to {best_grade:A+} based on the paper-specific evaluation criteria {eval_instructions:Social Media Article containing 750 to 1000 words (40%) References (30%) Grammar (20%) Reflections and Comparisons (10%)}. The Weights for the grading scale on the paper it self are as follows: {weights:Meets eval_instructions (30%) Spelling and semantics (10%) Expected performance for hand-in-type (50%)}}}}}}references (20%)}. Give arguments at the end in only short bullet-points for student to improve writing specific hand-in-type. Remember to check each weight and eval_instruction carefully. If a student has missed or failed on a criteria they are put at failed grade in that area, if they fail on more than two their paper is the lowest grade automatically.\n\n{student_text:Social media, it be affecting communication and stuff, you know what I'm saying? It's changed the way people communicate by making it easier and faster to connect with folks from all over the globe. However, it's also made communication more informal and less personal. One example of this is how people use abbreviations and emojis instead of full words and sentences. It's all like \"LOL,\" \"IDK,\" and \"SMH\" instead of saying \"laughing out loud,\" \"I don't know,\" or \"shaking my head.\" Another example is how people communicate more through text than through face-to-face conversation. It's all like, \"why talk in person when we can just text, right?\"  Overall, social media has had both good and bad effects on communication. On one hand, people are able to connect with others easier and faster, and they can share their thoughts and ideas with a wider audience. It's all like, \"I can just post my status or tweet my thoughts, and everyone can see it!\" On the other hand, communication has become less personal and more casual, and it can be difficult to fully express emotions and feelings through text or social media posts. Plus, there's the whole issue of cyberbullying, where people can say hurtful things online without facing consequences.  In conclusion, social media has had a huge impact on communication, and it's not always a good one. It's made communication faster and more convenient, but it's also made it less personal and more informal. We need to be mindful of how we use social media and remember the importance of face-to-face communication and human interaction. Because at the end of the day, that's what truly connects us as human beings.}",

    "input1": " Social media has revolutionized communication, allowing individuals to connect instantly across vast distances. However, this shift has led to a decline in the quality of interpersonal interactions. For instance, the prevalence of abbreviations and emojis has replaced traditional language, resulting in a loss of nuance and emotional depth. While platforms like Twitter and Instagram enable rapid sharing of thoughts, they often encourage superficial engagement rather than meaningful dialogue. Furthermore, the rise of cyberbullying highlights the darker side of online interactions, where anonymity can lead to harmful behavior. In summary, while social media offers unprecedented connectivity, it also poses significant challenges to authentic communication and emotional expression. We must strive to balance our online interactions with genuine, face-to-face conversations to preserve the essence of human connection.\n\n",
    "input2": " The impact of social media on communication is profound and multifaceted. On one hand, it facilitates immediate connections and the dissemination of information, allowing users to engage with diverse perspectives. For example, platforms like Facebook and TikTok enable users to share experiences and ideas with a global audience. However, this convenience comes at a cost; the informal nature of online communication often leads to misunderstandings and a lack of emotional intelligence. The reliance on text-based interactions can diminish the richness of human expression, as non-verbal cues are often lost. Additionally, the phenomenon of cyberbullying underscores the need for responsible online behavior. In conclusion, while social media enhances connectivity, it is crucial to remain aware of its potential to undermine the quality of our interactions. Prioritizing face-to-face communication can help mitigate these issues and foster deeper connections.",

        "The impact of social media on communication is profound and multifaceted. On one hand, it facilitates immediate connections and the dissemination of information, allowing users to engage with diverse perspectives. For example, platforms like Facebook and TikTok enable users to share experiences and ideas with a global audience. This instant access to information and the ability to connect with others across the globe can foster a sense of community and belonging, especially for individuals who may feel isolated in their immediate environments.\n\nHowever, this convenience comes at a cost; the informal nature of online communication often leads to misunderstandings and a lack of emotional intelligence. The reliance on text-based interactions can diminish the richness of human expression, as non-verbal cues\u2014such as tone of voice, facial expressions, and body language\u2014are often lost. This can result in misinterpretations of intent and meaning, leading to conflicts that might not occur in face-to-face conversations.\n\nMoreover, the phenomenon of cyberbullying underscores the need for responsible online behavior. The anonymity provided by social media can embolden individuals to engage in harmful behaviors that they might avoid in person. This not only affects the victims but also creates a toxic environment that can deter open and honest communication.\n\nIn conclusion, while social media enhances connectivity, it is crucial to remain aware of its potential to undermine the quality of our interactions. The ease of communication should not overshadow the importance of emotional intelligence and the nuances of human interaction. Prioritizing face-to-face communication can help mitigate these issues and foster deeper connections. By being mindful of how we engage online, we can harness the benefits of social media while minimizing its drawbacks, ultimately leading to more meaningful and fulfilling relationships."
