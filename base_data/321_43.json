I also have a dry cough that seems to worsen at night. My appetite has decreased, and I've lost about 5 pounds without trying. I have a family history of asthma and heart disease, which concerns me.",

Have you experienced any changes in your vision, sensitivity to light, or any other neurological symptoms?\n4. How would you describe the nature of the headache? Is it throbbing, dull, or sharp?\n5. Have you taken any medications or treatments for these headaches, and if so, what has been their effect?\n\nPlease provide as much detail as possible.",
