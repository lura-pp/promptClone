    "split_prompt": "This is a prompt description:```json\n{\n    \"spliting prompt\": {\n        \"topic\": [\n            \"Disturbing facts about nature\"\n        ],\n        \"task\": [\n            \"write\",\n            \"generate\"\n        ],\n        \"quantity\": [\n            \"3\"\n        ],\n        \"length\": [\n            \"around 400 letters\"\n        ]\n    }\n}\n```",
    "input1": " Did you know that the ocean is home to a phenomenon called \"bioluminescence,\" where certain organisms, like jellyfish and plankton, emit light? This eerie glow can be mesmerizing but also serves as a warning sign of environmental distress. Additionally, the deep sea is filled with bizarre creatures, such as the anglerfish, which uses a bioluminescent lure to attract prey in the pitch-black depths, showcasing nature's dark creativity.\n\n",
    "input2": " In the animal kingdom, the parasitic wasp lays its eggs inside living caterpillars, where the larvae feed on the host's insides, eventually leading to its demise. This gruesome survival tactic highlights the brutal realities of nature. Furthermore, certain fungi, like the \"zombie-ant fungus,\" infect ants and manipulate their behavior, forcing them to climb to high places before killing them, illustrating the chilling interplay of life and death in the natural world.",

        "1. The \"Zombie Ant Fungus\" (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) infects ants, taking control of their behavior. Once infected, the ant climbs to a high point, where the fungus kills it and sprouts from its head, releasing spores to infect others. This gruesome cycle highlights nature's brutal survival strategies.\n\n2. In the Arctic, the phenomenon of \"blood falls\" occurs when iron-rich water seeps from glaciers, oxidizing and turning red. This eerie sight is a stark reminder of the harsh conditions and extreme environments that exist on our planet, often hidden beneath the ice.\n\n3. The \"Immortal Jellyfish\" (Turritopsis dohrnii) can revert to its juvenile form after maturing, effectively allowing it to escape death. This unique ability raises unsettling questions about the nature of life and death, challenging our understanding of aging and survival in the natural world.",
        "1. Nature's cycle of life can be brutal, especially in the animal kingdom. For instance, the female praying mantis often devours her mate after mating. This gruesome act, known as sexual cannibalism, ensures that the female receives vital nutrients to support her offspring. While it may seem shocking, this behavior is a survival strategy that highlights the harsh realities of nature's reproductive tactics.\n\n2. In the world of fungi, the \"zombie-ant fungus\" (Ophiocordyceps unilateralis) takes control of its host in a chilling manner. This parasitic fungus infects ants, manipulating their behavior to climb to a high point before killing them. Once the ant is dead, the fungus sprouts from its body, releasing spores to infect more ants. This gruesome cycle illustrates the dark side of nature's interconnectedness and the lengths organisms will go to survive.\n\n3. The phenomenon of \"cannibalism\" is not limited to land animals; it also occurs in the ocean. Certain species of fish, like the sand tiger shark, practice intrauterine cannibalism, where the largest embryos consume their smaller siblings while still in the womb. This ensures that only the strongest survive to be born, showcasing the ruthless competition for survival that exists even before birth in the animal kingdom."

        "1. The \"Immortal Jellyfish\" (Turritopsis dohrnii) can revert to its juvenile form after maturing, effectively allowing it to escape death. This unique ability raises unsettling questions about the nature of life and mortality in the animal kingdom.\n\n2. In the deep ocean, the anglerfish uses a bioluminescent lure to attract prey, often leading to a gruesome fate. Once caught, the prey is devoured whole, showcasing the dark side of survival in the abyss.\n\n3. The \"cicada killer\" wasp paralyzes cicadas and drags them to its burrow, where it lays an egg on the still-living cicada. The larva then feeds on the cicada, ensuring a fresh meal while it grows, exemplifying nature's brutal cycle of life and death.",
        "Nature often reveals its darker side through disturbing survival strategies. One such example is the parasitic wasp, which lays its eggs inside living caterpillars. As the larvae develop, they consume the host from within, ultimately leading to the caterpillar's death. This gruesome method of reproduction underscores the harsh realities of the animal kingdom, where survival often comes at a high cost.\n\nAnother unsettling aspect of nature is the \"zombie-ant fungus.\" This parasitic fungus infects ants and takes control of their nervous systems, compelling them to climb to elevated locations. Once the ant reaches a suitable spot, the fungus kills it and sprouts from its body, releasing spores to infect more ants. This chilling manipulation showcases the intricate and often brutal relationships between species in the ecosystem.\n\nLastly, consider the phenomenon of brood parasitism, where birds like the cuckoo lay their eggs in the nests of other species. The unsuspecting host birds raise the cuckoo chicks, often at the expense of their own offspring. This deceitful strategy highlights the lengths to which some species will go to ensure their survival, revealing the ruthless competition inherent in nature."
