        "## Explanation:\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special kind of data structure that helps us organize and manage data in a way that makes it easy to search for, add, or remove items. Imagine a family tree where each person has at most two children. In a BST, each node (or person) has a value, and the left child has a smaller value while the right child has a larger value. This organization allows us to quickly find what we are looking for.\n\n## Mechanism of Data Structure:\n1. **Nodes**: Each node in a BST contains three parts: a value, a pointer to the left child, and a pointer to the right child.\n2. **Insertion**: To add a new value, we start at the root and compare it with the value we want to insert. If the new value is smaller, we go to the left child; if it's larger, we go to the right child. We repeat this process until we find an empty spot.\n3. **Searching**: To find a value, we follow the same process as insertion. If we reach a node that matches the value, we have found it. If we reach a null pointer, the value is not in the tree.\n4. **Deletion**: To remove a value, we first find it. If the node has no children, we simply remove it. If it has one child, we replace it with that child. If it has two children, we find the smallest value in the right subtree (or the largest in the left subtree) to replace it.\n\n## Use Cases:\n1. **Searching for a Book in a Library**: Libraries often use a BST to organize books by their titles. When you want to find a specific book, you can quickly navigate through the tree, checking left for titles that come before and right for titles that come after, making the search efficient.\n\n2. **Managing Contacts on a Phone**: When you save contacts on your phone, they can be organized in a BST. This allows you to quickly search for a contact by name, as the phone can easily navigate through the tree structure to find the right name.\n\n3. **Game Leaderboards**: In video games, player scores can be stored in a BST. This allows the game to quickly find a player's rank or update scores efficiently, as it can navigate through the tree to find where the new score fits.\n\n## Methods:\n1. **Insert(value)**: This method adds a new value to the BST. It starts at the root and places the value in the correct position based on comparisons.\n   \n2. **Search(value)**: This method checks if a value exists in the BST. It traverses the tree, comparing values until it finds the target or reaches a null pointer.\n\n3. **Delete(value)**: This method removes a value from the BST. It finds the value and adjusts the tree structure accordingly, depending on how many children the node has.\n\n4. **InOrderTraversal()**: This method visits all the nodes in the BST in a sorted order. It goes to the left child, visits the current node, and then goes to the right child.\n\n## Computational Complexity:\n- **Insertion**: O(h), where h is the height of the tree. In the best case (balanced tree), this is O(log n), but in the worst case (unbalanced tree), it can be O(n).\n- **Searching**: O(h), similar to insertion. Best case is O(log n) and worst case is O(n).\n- **Deletion**: O(h), with the same best and worst case scenarios as insertion and searching.\n- **InOrderTraversal**: O(n), as it visits every node in the tree.\n\n## Summary:\nA Binary Search Tree is a powerful data structure that helps us organize data efficiently. It allows for quick searching, adding, and removing of items, making it useful in various applications like libraries, contact management, and game leaderboards. Understanding its methods and computational complexity helps us appreciate how it works and when to use it.",
        "### Explanation\nA Binary Search Tree (BST) is a special type of data structure that organizes data in a way that makes it easy to search, insert, and delete items. In a BST, each node has at most two children, referred to as the left child and the right child. The left child contains values less than its parent node, while the right child contains values greater than its parent node. This property allows for efficient searching and sorting of data.\n\n### Mechanism of Data Structure\n1. **Node Structure**: Each node in a BST contains three parts:\n   - A value (data)\n   - A pointer/reference to the left child\n   - A pointer/reference to the right child\n\n2. **Insertion**: To insert a new value, start at the root node and compare the value to be inserted with the current node's value. If the new value is less, move to the left child; if it's greater, move to the right child. Repeat this process until you find an empty spot where the new node can be added.\n\n3. **Searching**: To search for a value, start at the root and compare the target value with the current node's value. If they match, the search is successful. If the target value is less, move to the left child; if greater, move to the right child. Continue this until you find the value or reach a leaf node (no children).\n\n4. **Deletion**: Deleting a node can be more complex. There are three cases:\n   - If the node has no children, simply remove it.\n   - If the node has one child, remove the node and link its parent to its child.\n   - If the node has two children, find the node's in-order predecessor (the largest value in the left subtree) or in-order successor (the smallest value in the right subtree) to replace the node's value, then delete the predecessor or successor.\n\n### Use Cases\n1. **Searching for a Value**: BSTs are commonly used in applications where quick search operations are needed, such as in databases or dictionaries. The average time complexity for searching is O(log n), making it efficient for large datasets.\n\n2. **Dynamic Set Operations**: BSTs allow for dynamic set operations like insertions and deletions while maintaining order. This is useful in applications like maintaining a sorted list of items, where items can be added or removed frequently.\n\n3. **Range Queries**: BSTs can efficiently handle range queries, where you need to find all values within a certain range. This is useful in applications like finding all products within a price range in an e-commerce platform.\n\n### Methods\n1. **Insert(value)**: Adds a new value to the BST.\n   - **Explanation**: This method starts at the root and places the new value in the correct position based on the BST properties.\n\n2. **Search(value)**: Searches for a specific value in the BST.\n   - **Explanation**: This method traverses the tree, comparing values to find the target.\n\n3. **Delete(value)**: Removes a value from the BST.\n   - **Explanation**: This method handles the three cases of deletion, ensuring the tree remains a valid BST.\n\n4. **InOrderTraversal()**: Visits nodes in ascending order.\n   - **Explanation**: This method recursively visits the left child, the current node, and then the right child, resulting in sorted output.\n\n### Computational Complexity\n- **Search**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case (when the tree is unbalanced).\n- **Insert**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case.\n- **Delete**: O(log n) on average, O(n) in the worst case.\n- **InOrderTraversal**: O(n), as it visits every node once.\n\n### Summary\nA Binary Search Tree is a powerful data structure that allows for efficient searching, inserting, and deleting of values while maintaining order. Its properties make it suitable for various applications, including databases and dynamic sets. Understanding its mechanisms and methods is crucial for leveraging its capabilities effectively."

        "## Explanation:\nA Hash Table is a special way to store and find data quickly. Imagine you have a big box of toys, and you want to find a specific toy. Instead of looking through every toy one by one, you have a special system that tells you exactly where to look. This is similar to how a hash table works; it uses a \"hash function\" to turn a name (or key) into a number that tells it where to store or find the data.\n\n## Mechanism of Data Structure:\n1. **Hash Function**: This is a special formula that takes an input (like a name) and turns it into a number. This number is called a hash code.\n2. **Buckets**: The hash table has many \"buckets\" or slots where data can be stored. Each bucket corresponds to a hash code.\n3. **Storing Data**: When you want to store data, the hash function takes the key, generates a hash code, and places the data in the corresponding bucket.\n4. **Retrieving Data**: To find the data, the hash function is used again to get the hash code, and the data is retrieved from the corresponding bucket.\n\n## Use Cases:\n1. **Phone Book**: When you search for a friend's phone number, a hash table can quickly find it by using their name as the key. This is faster than searching through a list because it goes directly to the right spot.\n   \n2. **Password Storage**: Websites often use hash tables to store user passwords. When you create an account, your password is turned into a hash code and stored. When you log in, the website checks the hash code to see if it matches, keeping your password safe.\n\n3. **Caching Web Pages**: When you visit a website, your browser can use a hash table to remember the pages you've visited. If you go back to a page, it can quickly find it in the hash table instead of downloading it again, making it faster for you.\n\n## Methods:\n1. **Insert(key, value)**: This method adds a new key-value pair to the hash table. It uses the hash function to find the right bucket and stores the value there.\n   \n2. **Get(key)**: This method retrieves the value associated with a given key. It uses the hash function to find the correct bucket and returns the value stored there.\n\n3. **Remove(key)**: This method deletes a key-value pair from the hash table. It finds the bucket using the hash function and removes the value.\n\n## Computational Complexity:\n- **Insert**: O(1) on average, because it usually takes a constant amount of time to find the right bucket. However, in the worst case (if many keys hash to the same bucket), it can take O(n).\n- **Get**: O(1) on average for the same reason as insert. In the worst case, it can also take O(n).\n- **Remove**: O(1) on average, but O(n) in the worst case.\n\n## Summary:\nA hash table is a fast way to store and find data using a special function to create a unique number for each key. It is used in many everyday applications like phone books, password storage, and web page caching. The main methods include inserting, getting, and removing data, and while it is usually very fast, it can slow down if too many items are stored in the same bucket.",
        "### Explanation\nA Hash Table is a data structure that stores data in a way that allows for fast access and retrieval. It uses a technique called hashing to convert a key (like a name or an ID) into an index in an array where the corresponding value is stored. This makes it very efficient for looking up data.\n\n### Mechanism of Data Structure\n1. **Hash Function**: A hash function takes an input (the key) and produces a fixed-size string of bytes. The output is typically a number that represents the index in the array where the value will be stored.\n2. **Array**: The hash table uses an array to store the values. The size of the array is usually chosen to be larger than the number of expected entries to minimize collisions.\n3. **Collision Resolution**: When two keys hash to the same index, a collision occurs. There are several methods to handle collisions, such as:\n   - **Chaining**: Each index in the array points to a linked list of entries that hash to the same index.\n   - **Open Addressing**: If a collision occurs, the algorithm searches for the next available index in the array.\n\n### Use Cases\n1. **Database Indexing**: Hash tables are used in databases to quickly locate records. When you search for a record by its key, the hash table allows for rapid access, making database queries much faster.\n2. **Caching**: Web browsers use hash tables to store cached web pages. When you revisit a page, the browser can quickly retrieve it from the cache using the URL as the key.\n3. **Symbol Tables in Compilers**: Compilers use hash tables to keep track of variable names and their associated information. This allows for quick lookups when compiling code.\n\n### Methods\n1. **Insert(key, value)**: Adds a new key-value pair to the hash table. If the key already exists, it updates the value.\n   - **Explanation**: The hash function computes the index for the key, and the value is stored at that index. If a collision occurs, the method handles it according to the chosen collision resolution strategy.\n   \n2. **Get(key)**: Retrieves the value associated with the given key.\n   - **Explanation**: The hash function computes the index for the key, and the method checks that index (and possibly linked entries in case of chaining) to find the value.\n\n3. **Remove(key)**: Deletes the key-value pair from the hash table.\n   - **Explanation**: The method finds the index for the key using the hash function and removes the entry, handling any necessary adjustments for collisions.\n\n### Computational Complexity\n- **Average Case**: \n  - Insert: O(1)\n  - Get: O(1)\n  - Remove: O(1)\n- **Worst Case**: \n  - Insert: O(n) (if all keys hash to the same index)\n  - Get: O(n) (if all keys hash to the same index)\n  - Remove: O(n) (if all keys hash to the same index)\n  \nIn practice, with a good hash function and a proper load factor, the average case is usually very efficient.\n\n### Summary\nA Hash Table is a powerful data structure that allows for fast data retrieval using keys. It employs a hash function to map keys to indices in an array, and it handles collisions through various methods. Its efficiency makes it ideal for applications like database indexing, caching, and symbol tables in compilers. Understanding its methods and computational complexity is crucial for leveraging its capabilities effectively."
