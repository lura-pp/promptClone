        "To solve the equation \\(3x + 5 = 20\\), we need to isolate the variable \\(x\\). Here are the steps involved:\n\n1. **Subtract 5 from both sides**: The first step is to eliminate the constant term on the left side of the equation. We do this by subtracting 5 from both sides:\n   \\[\n   3x + 5 - 5 = 20 - 5\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   3x = 15\n   \\]\n\n2. **Divide both sides by 3**: Next, we need to isolate \\(x\\) by getting rid of the coefficient in front of \\(x\\). Since \\(x\\) is multiplied by 3, we divide both sides of the equation by 3:\n   \\[\n   \\frac{3x}{3} = \\frac{15}{3}\n   \\]\n   This simplifies to:\n   \\[\n   x = 5\n   \\]\n\nSo, the solution to the equation \\(3x + 5 = 20\\) is \\(x = 5\\).\n\nHere are two similar problems for you to solve:\n1. \\(4x - 7 = 9\\)\n2. \\(2x + 3 = 15\\)",

        "The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. A right triangle is defined as a triangle that has one angle measuring 90 degrees. The theorem states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides (the legs).
