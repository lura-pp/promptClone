        "To effectively learn and retain advanced Spanish vocabulary over the next three months using a spaced repetition schedule, we will break down the process into manageable segments. This schedule will include daily, weekly, and monthly reviews, gradually increasing the intervals between reviews as you become more familiar with the vocabulary.\n\n### Overview of the Schedule\n- **Duration**: 3 months (approximately 12 weeks)\n- **Daily Learning**: Introduce new vocabulary daily\n- **Review Intervals**: Use spaced repetition to review vocabulary at increasing intervals\n\n### Weekly Breakdown\n1. **Week 1-2**: Introduce 10 new words each day.\n2. **Week 3-4**: Introduce 5 new words each day, focusing on reviewing previously learned vocabulary.\n3. **Week 5-6**: Introduce 5 new words every other day, with more emphasis on review.\n4. **Week 7-12**: Focus on consolidating knowledge with fewer new words and more extensive review sessions.\n\n### Daily Schedule\n- **Day 1**: Introduce 10 new words. Review previous day\u2019s 10 words.\n- **Day 2**: Introduce 10 new words. Review Day 1\u2019s 10 words and Day 2\u2019s 10 words.\n- **Day 3**: Introduce 10 new words.
