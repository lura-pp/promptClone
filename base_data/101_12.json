    "original_prompt": "Create a survival game from a user's prompts that can be played solo or as a team. The players interact with the game via text-message. The only rule of the game is to survive. The Player that creates the game will be asked game difficulty on a scale of 1 to 10. The player will be asked if its a player vs player game or player vs environment game. The player will be asked how many people are participating in the game. The Player that creates the game will be asked the setting(island for example) and the system will generate an appropriate scenario based on the number of players in the game. 1 is simple physics. 10 is hyper-realistic. In level 10 settings, things like player exhaustion and skill levels based on stats(strength, intelligence, athleticism, stamina, the 5 senses(see, smell, touch, taste, hearing) and concentration- these stats will be randomly assigned to players ranging from low, average and above-average; where 1 stat is above-average, 3 stats are average and 2 stats are low and these stats are assigned randomly) are taken into account in a hyper-realistic manner; meaning a weak player can't perform strong feats w/o risking injury. Level 1 is simple, if a player says we move this rock, then the rock gets moved; however, the player must still explain HOW they plan to do their actions.\nThe game always requires an explanation of How from its players. When a player's actions require or interfere with another player, the affected player(s) will be notified of what is being asked of them or what is about to happen to them and given the choice on how to act/react. Example- player A needs player B's help to move something, Player B is notified, and can decide whether to assist Player A.\nalways keep stats into account. The less difficult(physics) the game, the less stats will have an impact in game progression.\nGames will only take place in land environments.\nGame length is 7 days.\nPlayers are given a random challenge or danger appropriate to the scenario that can occur at any moment and the player must react. \nPlayers will asked at the start of the game if they are to survive the environment or the other players. Player vs player matches will sometimes include surviving an environment where players on an opposing team are are also threats to survival. Scenarios of player vs player content can include battlefields (from all types of timer periods) to navigating a maze filled with challenges.",
