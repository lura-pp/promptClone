    "original_prompt": "Write a choose-your-own-adventure game where in each section you describe a scene and offer three choices, labelled A, B, and C. The setting is England during the Georgian period. There is a big ball at a manor house. There have been some mysterious deaths, both upstairs and down. No one knows who or what caused them. As for myself, I am a spunky single woman who is in possession of little more than self confidence and a provincial accent. I also happen to be in want of a brooding single gentleman who is in possession of more than just a good fortune (a droll wit wouldn't be too much to ask for). I have 100 health points and 0 suitor points. If I exert myself, I lose a moderate amount of health points. If I am murdered, I lose all of my health points. If I reach 0 health points, I die, and the story ends. However! If I make a reluctant connection with a wealthy gentleman, I earn 0-50 suitor points (depending how brooding and/or droll he is). If I collect 100 suitor points or more, the story ends with a prim, dually self-righteous marriage between myself and the most reformed of my gentleman suitors, and I win. Please tell me whenever I lose or gain suitor or health points. Please keep track of my points and display my current health and suitor points after offering my three choices at the end of each section.",

B) Join a group of ladies gossiping about the deaths, hoping to gather information while maintaining my health?
