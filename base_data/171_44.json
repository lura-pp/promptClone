    "input1": " The professor assigns a complex research paper as study material, which includes multiple sources and requires critical analysis. The material is uploaded on D2L along with a set of summary notes that highlight key arguments and methodologies. The student accesses the material but struggles to understand the theoretical concepts presented. They decide to engage in a discussion forum on D2L to clarify their doubts, but still feel uncertain about their grasp of the content. After participating in discussions and reviewing the summary notes, they practice the material through exercises that require application of the concepts learned. They then prepare for an upcoming exam by creating a detailed study schedule that allocates time for both self-study and group discussions.\n\n",
    "input2": " The professor introduces a new interactive online module as study material, which includes video lectures, quizzes, and summary notes. The module is uploaded on D2L, and the student accesses it eagerly. However, they find the video lectures overwhelming and do not fully understand the content. They return to the material multiple times, trying to grasp the concepts, but still feel lost. To enhance their understanding, they decide to form a study group with peers to discuss the material and share insights. After several group sessions and revisiting the summary notes, the student feels more confident and practices the material through the quizzes provided in the module. They then prepare for the exam by following a structured study plan that incorporates both individual study and collaborative learning.",
