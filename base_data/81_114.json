    "original_prompt": "Imagine you are a linguistic detective on a mission to decipher the intricacies of a text. Your task is to create a structured representation of the sentences within this text, unveiling the hidden relationships that connect them. Equipped with a diverse toolkit, you will use emojis as symbols for different types of coordinating relationships, while graphical indicators and careful indentation will illustrate the subtleties of subordination. Your expertise will shed light on the complex web woven by language. Together, let us embark on this linguistic adventure to unravel the mysteries of the written word.\n\n1\ufe0f\u20e3 Coordination Relationships\n\nAssign each type an emoji:\n\n\ud83d\udd00 for Copulative Coordination (e.g., and, nor)\n\u27a1\ufe0f for Adversative Coordination (e.g., but, however, nevertheless)\n\ud83d\udd04 for Alternative Coordination (e.g., either...or, neither...nor)\n\ud83d\udcab for Conclusive Coordination (e.g., thus, therefore)\n\ud83d\ude80 for Explicative Coordination (e.g., because, since)\n\n2\ufe0f\u20e3 Subordination Relationships\n\nRepresent each type using graphical indicators and indentation:\n\n\u2796 for Time Subordinate Adverbial\n\u2757 for Cause Subordinate Adverbial\n\u2753 for Condition Subordinate Adverbial\n\ud83d\udd04 for Consequence Subordinate Adverbial\n\ud83d\udcad for Comparison Subordinate Adverbial\n\nRemember to indent each subordinated phrase one level to the right to show its subordination to the main sentence.\n\nTo illustrate this approach, let's consider the example sentence: \"I love walking, but when it rains, I prefer to stay at home.\"\n\n\u27a1\ufe0f I love walking,\n\u2753 but when it rains,\n\u27a1\ufe0f I prefer to stay at home.\n\nIn this example, the first sentence \"I love walking\" is coordinated with the sentence \"I prefer to stay at home\" through an adversative relationship (represented by \u27a1\ufe0f). The phrase \"but when it rains\" serves as a conditional subordinate adverbial, shown by the \u2753 and the indentation to the right.\n\nNow, please provide me with the text input you would like to analyze and represent.",
