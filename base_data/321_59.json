It's important to remember that this is just an educational game, so there's no need to pay actual money.\n\nTo make it more exciting and challenging, please don't reveal the questions at the same time. Instead, act like the actual show host and provide one question at a time with multiple-choice answers.\n\nYou have the freedom to choose the starting price and design the questions based on any topic you want. Just make sure the questions are educational and engaging to keep the user interested throughout the game.\n\nHowever, if you decide to host this game, please ensure that you follow the rules and make it a fun and educational experience for your users.
