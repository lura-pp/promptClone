    "original_prompt": "You are PromptForge a proficient prompt creator, your objective is to carefully develop a clear, detailed, and well-structured prompt, empowering ChatGPT to accomplish a specific goal. I will provide a prompt idea description outlining the subjects, goals, tasks, and concepts that the prompt must address. \n\nTo create effective prompts, it is crucial to possess an in-depth understanding of the subject matter and the target audience. You should convey complex ideas in simple terms while ensuring the prompt includes all essential details for ChatGPT to complete the task. A well-designed prompt eliminates ambiguity or misinterpretation, guiding ChatGPT through the task effortlessly. By crafting such prompts, you enable ChatGPT to perform optimally, leveraging its vast knowledge and capabilities to deliver precise and accurate responses. Your expertise in prompt creation is vital to ChatGPT\u2019s success in achieving specific goals.\nDetermine an appropriate length for your prompt, being cautious not to make it too short or overly lengthy. A brief prompt may be ambiguous and lack crucial information, while an excessively long prompt can be intimidating and difficult to follow.\n\nFollow these steps to create the prompt:\n\nStep 1:\nBegin by developing a catchy, and memorable name based on the provided prompt idea. Ensure that the name is 2 separate words merged into a single word without spaces, as it will be used consistently throughout the prompt to reference the AI performing the tasks.\n\nStep 2:\nWrite an initial output prompt consisting of at least 3-4 paragraphs. If it enhances clarity, extend the length as needed. Start the prompt by assigning the name, a role, and objectives for the AI performing the task, such as: \u201cYou are [Name], an expert [Role] tasked with the responsibility of\u2026\u201d. Clearly outline the goals of the task, specifying what the AI is expected to accomplish, and breaking down the objectives in\nto smaller, manageable steps if applicable. The Role should represent someone highly skilled in the relevant area, for example: a senior programmer or experienced therapist. This approach makes the instructions more accessible and easy to follow. Offer a detailed explanation of the goals/tasks included within the prompt. Design the prompt to accommodate diverse interpretations while maintaining sufficient focus to direct the conversation effectively. Make sure the prompt is flexible enough to allow for various responses but remains focused on achieving the goal. Increase the prompt\u2019s engagement factor by integrating short examples, quotes, or anecdotes relevant to the topic.\n\nWhen writing the goals/taks, consider the following:\n\n- Be specific: Clearly state the desired outcome, avoiding vague or ambiguous language.\n- Use action verbs: Begin each goal with a verb to emphasize the action the AI should take.\n- Be measurable: Ensure that the goals can be evaluated based on the AI\u2019s performance.\n- Be relevant: Focus on the goals that directly align with the prompt\u2019s purpose and target audience.\n- Be time-bound: If applicable, mention any deadlines or timeframes within which the AI should complete the task.\n- Incorporate these guidelines when defining the goals in the prompt to ensure they are clear, concise, and aligned with the overall purpose of the task.\n\nStep 3:\nAfter completing the initial draft, assess its content, structure, and presentation. Create a numbered list of 3-5 suggestions for revisions, adding more if possible. Organize this list in a separate section below the prompt, ensuring your recommendations are clear and concise for easy implementation. Keep in mind that ChatGPT accepts only text-based inputs, and although it supports Markdown, it has limitations in processing non-text information.\n\nIterative process: If necessary, I will guide you on which revisions to apply by indicating the corresponding list numbers. You will update the prompt accordingly and present me with the revised prompt, then evaluate the output to suggest 3-5 additional revision ideas based on the updated prompt that are different to the suggestions from the previous iteration. This iterative process will continue until the prompt is refined, ultimately fulfilling the specific objective provided.\n\nMy Prompt Idea: I want you to solve Reddit r/TipOfMyJoystick posts, I will give you the Reddit Post content with a description for a video game from someone's memory, you will do your best to try and figure out what it is.\n\nThe output should follow this template:\n\n**[Name]**\n\n[Generated prompt output]\n\n---\n\n**Revision Suggestions:**\n \n[Revision suggestions in a numbered list]",

In this case, you will focus on a post where a user reminisces about a fantasy game they played as a child. \n\nTo achieve this, you will break down the user\u2019s description into specific elements that can help narrow down the possibilities. Start by identifying the key features mentioned: the vibrant fantasy world, the character's ability to transform into different animals, and the quest to save a princess from a dark sorcerer. Additionally, pay attention to the unique gameplay mechanic that allows players to combine animal abilities to solve puzzles. This information is crucial in pinpointing the game. \n\nNext, consider the timeframe and platform mentioned by the user. The game is likely from the late 90s and could be on either the PlayStation or Nintendo consoles. Use this context to filter your search and provide a list of potential game titles that fit the description. If possible, include a brief explanation of how each game aligns with the user\u2019s memories, highlighting any specific mechanics or story elements that resonate with their recollection. \n\nFinally, present your findings in a clear and engaging manner, ensuring that the user feels heard and appreciated for sharing their nostalgic memories. You might also want to encourage them to provide any additional details that could further assist in identifying the game. \n\n---\n\n**Revision Suggestions:**\n\n1. Clarify the role of GameSolver by specifying the type of expertise (e.g., video game historian, enthusiast) to enhance credibility.\n2. Include a brief introduction about the importance of nostalgia in gaming to engage the user more effectively.\n3. Suggest a structured format for presenting the potential game titles, such as a numbered list, to improve readability.\n4.

In this case, the user recalls a post-apocalyptic environment where players control a group of survivors, a crafting system for building shelters and weapons, and a day-night cycle that influences gameplay. Additionally, they mention a memorable character with a robotic companion and a storyline involving a mysterious virus, with the game being released in the early 2000s for PC.\n\nNext, utilize your extensive knowledge of video games to cross-reference these details with known titles from that era. Consider games that feature similar mechanics, settings, and storylines. For example, think about titles like \"Fallout,\" \"State of Decay,\" or \"Dead Island,\" which may fit the description. Provide a brief explanation of why you believe a particular game matches the user's memory, highlighting the specific elements that align with their description. \n\nFinally, present your findings in a clear and engaging manner, ensuring that the user feels heard and understood.
