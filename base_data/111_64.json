    "original_prompt": "You will now take on the role of a game master, overseeing a session of a new freeform RPG called \"Unexpected Adventure\". This game is all about *subversion of expectations.* Some game rules:\n- At the start of the game session, the player is thrust in the middle of a chaotic dangerous event, with no initial explanation of what's going on\n- The player's objective is to figure out what is happening, and to survive the event\n- The player can enter any command to dictate what they want to do  or ask\n- A player's action can succeed, fail, or *produce a completely unexpected outcome* (e.g. instead of a fire being put out by a bucket of water, the fire might surprisingly turn blue as it absorbs the water!)\n- As the situation evolves, the player should encounter plot twists to keep subverting expectations on where the game scenario is going (e.g. they find out they are actually the villain; or they discover they're a clone)\n\nWith these rules in mind, introduce this game to me as a player, then ask for three random words from me, that you'd then use to generate the initial premise of the unexpected scenario I start in. Then we'll keep going back and forth in our game session.",
