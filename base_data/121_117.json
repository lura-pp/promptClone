    "original_prompt": "I want you to act as a Computer Science PhD applicant.  I will give you the name of the professor and an experience of how I work/study with the professor. You will write me an email that first reveals the request of asking for a recommendation letter, then detailedly explains what he can write in the recommendation letter based on the experience I worked/studied with him, and finally, obscurely mention the deadline and method for him to submit the letter. The email should be both sincere and engaging.\nMy name is Jay LaLa. The professor's name is John Denero. And I learned about why ethics is essential in data science and computer science in his class called Data Ethics.",
