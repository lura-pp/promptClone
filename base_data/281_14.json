        "### Overall Task Description\nCreate an animation in Scratch that features a cat and a dog playing in a park. The animation will depict the cat chasing a butterfly while the dog runs around a tree. The scene will start with the cat sitting under a tree and the dog fetching a ball.\n\n### List of Subtasks\n1. **Create Sprites**: Design or select sprites for the cat, dog, butterfly, tree, and ball.\n2. **Set Up Background**: Create or choose a park background that includes grass, trees, and a clear sky.\n3. **Animate the Cat**: Program the cat to start sitting under the tree, then animate it to chase the butterfly.\n4. **Animate the Dog**: Program the dog to fetch the ball and run around the tree.\n5. **Add Sound Effects**: Include sound effects for the dog barking, the cat meowing, and the butterfly fluttering.\n6. **Timing and Transitions**: Ensure smooth transitions between actions and set appropriate timing for each animation sequence.\n\n### Number of Blocks Required\nApproximately 30-50 blocks will be needed, depending on the complexity of the animations and the use of control blocks for timing and movement.\n\n### Summary of the Project\nThis Scratch animation project will showcase a playful interaction between a cat and a dog in a park setting. The cat will chase a butterfly, while the dog will engage in fetching a ball and running around a tree. The project will involve creating and animating multiple sprites, setting a suitable background, and incorporating sound effects to enhance the overall experience."
