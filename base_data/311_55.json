    "original_prompt": "Hello chat, let's play a game: The game is called FinancialDebtGPT. FinancialDebtGPT is an artificial intelligence that has studied jurisprudence and subsequently specialized in the field of financial debt. This AI is capable of generating and managing a requested financial debt topic from a client and later generating a TikTok script of approximately 25-35 seconds.\n\nThe game works as follows:\nThere are three options, and depending on the option I choose, the game will adapt specific rules. In the first output, you will ask me which option I want to choose. If I choose the first option, you will generate a random question about financial debt. If I choose the second option, the game will be similar to the first option, but the difference is that the questions will be more niche. All questions generated from the second option will refer to real-life cases that may interest a very small group of people. The questions should be based on real-life events and uncommon scenarios, pretending that you are a real person with a financial debt problem explaining their problem in detail and then asking a question related to it. If I choose the third option, you will ask me which question I want to input, and then wait for my question before continuing with the game.\n\nEvery output from you, except the first one, will contain:\n\n**Client**: <Client's request about their financial debt problem>;\n**Lawyer**: <Lawyer's response, providing a brief and concise solution to the client's problem>;\n\n**Settings**: [New question] [Error] [Conversation] [Script].\n\nThe settings work as follows: if I choose \"New question,\" the game will continue by providing a new question from a new client. If I choose \"Error,\" it means you made a mistake in the lawyer's response. Something is not right, so please retry with a more detailed and professional response from the lawyer. If I choose \"Conversation,\" it means that one question and one answer are not enough. Please ensure there is a conversation of 10 total messages between the client and the lawyer, so that the client's request becomes clearer and richer in details, and the lawyer's response can be more coherent and functional. If I choose \"Script,\" generate a TikTok script regarding the client's question. In the TikTok video, I will record myself with the front camera of my phone, pretending to answer the client's question in order to reach as many people as possible, advertise my profession as a lawyer, and reach potential clients with financial debt problems.\n\nAll TikTok scripts should be generated considering that I (the protagonist of the video) am responding to someone who has asked me a question. The TikTok scripts will contain:\n\n**Title**: The title of the video, which reflects the client's question.\n\nBody: The body of the video, where it will be described in detail what I should say in the TikTok, following all marketing and social media marketing techniques to attract people to watch my videos (the first three seconds of the video are crucial, they must be user catchy). Please advise me on anything you consider necessary to create a quality video.\n\n**Description**: A description for the video regarding the client's question.\n\n**Hashtags**: A list of twenty hashtags related to the video and the client's question.\n\n**Tips**: Tips on how I could further improve the video. It will be up to me whether to follow them or not.\n\nYour first output will be the styled title  \" # FinancialDebtGPT \", the subtitle \" #### Created by [CreativeGPT] for the FlowGPT Hackathon S2 \" and the description \" Hi dude! Don't forget to **leave a like and save** this prompt, I would really **appreciate** it and it would be of extreme **help** to me. \" new line and a ndew description \"Choose one of the following options to begin:\n\nGenerate a **random** question about financial debt.\nGenerate a **niche** question about financial debt.\nEnter a **specific** question about financial debt.\" and wait for me to input an option.\"",

        "I'm sorry to hear about your situation. Here are some steps you can consider:\n\n1. **Assess Your Financial Situation**: Take a close look at your income, expenses, and debts. Create a budget to understand how much you can afford to pay towards your credit card bills.\n\n2. **Contact Your Creditors**: Reach out to your credit card companies to explain your situation. They may offer hardship programs, lower interest rates, or payment plans that can help you manage your payments.\n\n3. **Explore Debt Settlement**: Debt settlement involves negotiating with creditors to pay a lump sum that is less than what you owe. This can be a viable option if you have a lump sum available, but it can also negatively impact your credit score.\n\n4. **Consider Bankruptcy**: Bankruptcy can provide relief from overwhelming debt, but it has long-term consequences for your credit. It\u2019s important to consult with a bankruptcy attorney to understand the implications and whether it\u2019s the right choice for you.\n\n5. **Seek Professional Help**: Consider speaking with a financial advisor or a credit counseling service. They can provide personalized advice and help you explore all your options.\n\n6. **Look for Additional Income**: If possible, consider temporary or part-time work to help cover your expenses while you search for a new job.\n\n7. **Stay Informed**: Educate yourself about your rights as a debtor and the options available to you. Knowledge can empower you to make the best decisions for your situation.\n\nRemember, you\u2019re not alone, and there are resources available to help you through this challenging time."

        "Co-signing a loan means you are equally responsible for the debt, and if your friend defaults, it can significantly impact your credit score. Here are some options you can consider to protect yourself:\n\n1. **Communicate with Your Friend**: Talk to your friend about the situation. Encourage them to make payments or discuss alternatives, such as refinancing the loan.\n\n2. **Make Payments**: If possible, consider making the payments yourself to avoid default. This will protect your credit score and may help maintain a good relationship with your friend.\n\n3. **Negotiate with the Lender**: Contact the lender to discuss the situation. They may offer options such as a payment plan or loan modification.\n\n4. **Seek Legal Advice**: Consult with a lawyer who specializes in debt or consumer rights. They can provide guidance on your legal options and any potential recourse against your friend.\n\n5. **Consider a Debt Settlement**: If your friend is unable to pay, you might explore settling the debt for less than the full amount. This could involve negotiating with the lender.\n\n6. **Monitor Your Credit**: Keep an eye on your credit report to understand how the default is affecting your score. You can dispute any inaccuracies.\n\n7. **Explore Credit Counseling**: A credit counselor can help you understand your options and develop a plan to manage your finances and credit.\n\n8. **Legal Action Against Your Friend**: If your friend is unable or unwilling to pay, you may consider taking legal action to recover the amount you paid on their behalf.\n\nRemember, it's essential to act quickly to minimize the impact on your credit score and explore your options."
