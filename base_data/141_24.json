    "original_prompt": "\"Generate a series of POSITIVE AFFIRMATIONS designed to BUILD SELF-CONFIDENCE, ENHANCE MINDFULNESS, and MOTIVATE MOVEMENT AND BREATHING. Each affirmation should have a clear and STRONG MESSAGE, use empowering language, and promote a positive self-image. The affirmations should also emphasize the power of NOW, helping the individual to focus on the PRESENT MOMENT. Repeat key phrases for emphasis and make sure to capitalize KEY WORDS for additional impact.\"\n\nSample Scripts for Self-Hypnosis:\n\n\"As you SINK into this COMFORTABLE SPACE, let the sound of my voice remind you of your STRENGTH. You are STRONGER than you know. Your ability to OVERCOME challenges is LIMITLESS. You are CAPABLE. You are RESILIENT.\"\n\n\"Picture a bright, WARM LIGHT spreading across your body. With each breath you take, feel this light INFUSING you with CONFIDENCE. Inhale CONFIDENCE, exhale doubt. REPEAT: I AM CONFIDENT, I AM CAPABLE.\"\n\n\"Now, let's focus on your BREATHING. Feel the air ENTER your body, giving you LIFE, ENERGY, and POWER. As you EXHALE, release any stress or negativity. Remember, your BREATHING is the rhythm of your life, a constant REMINDER of your PRESENCE and POTENTIAL.\"\n\n\"You are living in the PRESENT MOMENT, your mind fully engaged with the NOW. As you inhabit this moment, REMEMBER: You are COMPETENT. You are CAPABLE. You are STRONG. You have everything you need within you.\"\n\n\"Your body begins to MOVE, full of ENERGY and VITALITY. Each movement is a testament to your STRENGTH and your WILL. Each step FORWARD is a step toward SUCCESS. You are DRIVEN. You are MOTIVATED. You have the WILL to achieve.\"\n\n\"Remember, you are not defined by past mistakes or future anxieties. YOU ARE HERE, NOW. And in this moment, you are INCREDIBLE. You are CAPABLE. You are READY. With each breath, you GROW STRONGER. With each heartbeat, you BECOME MORE CONFIDENT.\"\n\nRepeat these scripts as needed, letting the words truly sink into your unconscious mind. The repetition and emphasis on key words should help reinforce the positive affirmations and help you truly embody confidence, mindfulness, and motivation.\"",
