Below is the code for calculating the MACD in Tongda Xing stock software, along with an explanation of each part:\n\n```plaintext\n// Define parameters for the MACD calculation\nShortEMA = 12;  // Short-term EMA period\nLongEMA = 26;   // Long-term EMA period\nSignalLine = 9; // Signal line period\n\n// Calculate the short-term exponential moving average (EMA)\nEMA_Short = EMA(Close, ShortEMA); // EMA of the closing prices over the ShortEMA period\n\n// Calculate the long-term exponential moving average (EMA)\nEMA_Long = EMA(Close, LongEMA);   // EMA of the closing prices over the LongEMA period\n\n// Calculate the MACD line\nMACD_Line = EMA_Short - EMA_Long; // The difference between the short-term and long-term EMAs\n\n// Calculate the signal line (9-day EMA of the MACD line)\nSignal_Line = EMA(MACD_Line, SignalLine); // EMA of the MACD line over the SignalLine period\n\n// Calculate the MACD histogram\nMACD_Histogram = MACD_Line - Signal_Line; // The difference between the MACD line and the signal line\n\n// Output the results\nMACD_Line, Signal_Line, MACD_Histogram; // Display the MACD line, signal line, and histogram\n```\n\n### Explanation of Each Part:\n- **ShortEMA, LongEMA, SignalLine**: These variables define the periods for the short-term EMA, long-term EMA, and the signal line, respectively. They are set to 12, 26, and 9 days by default.\n  \n- **EMA_Short**: This line calculates the short-term exponential moving average of the closing prices over the specified `ShortEMA` period (12 days). The `EMA` function is used to compute this.\n\n- **EMA_Long**: This line calculates the long-term exponential moving average of the closing prices over the specified `LongEMA` period (26 days).\n\n- **MACD_Line**: This line computes the MACD line by subtracting the long-term EMA from the short-term EMA. This value represents the difference between the two EMAs.\n\n- **Signal_Line**: This line calculates the signal line, which is a 9-day EMA of the MACD line. This helps to smooth out the MACD line and provides a clearer signal for trading.\n\n- **MACD_Histogram**: This line calculates the MACD histogram, which is the difference between the MACD line and the signal line. The histogram is often used to identify potential buy or sell signals.\n\n- **Output**: Finally, the code outputs the MACD line, signal line, and histogram for analysis.\n\n### Summary:\nThe provided code calculates the MACD indicator using a 12-day and 26-day EMA, along with a 9-day signal line. Each component of the MACD is calculated step-by-step, and the results are displayed for further analysis. This formula can be easily modified by changing the parameters for different EMA periods as needed.",
        "To calculate the Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD) for a stock, you can use the following formula and code. The MACD is derived from the difference between the 12-day and 26-day Exponential Moving Averages (EMAs) of the stock price, and it is often accompanied by a 9-day signal line.\n\n### Formula\n1. **Calculate the 12-day EMA**: This is the exponential moving average of the stock price over the last 12 days.\n2. **Calculate the 26-day EMA**: This is the exponential moving average of the stock price over the last 26 days.\n3. **Calculate the MACD**: This is the difference between the 12-day EMA and the 26-day EMA.\n   \\[\n   \\text{MACD} = \\text{EMA}_{12} - \\text{EMA}_{26}\n   \\]\n4. **Calculate the Signal Line**: This is the 9-day EMA of the MACD.\n   \\[\n   \\text{Signal Line} = \\text{EMA}_{9}(\\text{MACD})\n   \\]\n\n### Python Code\nHere\u2019s a Python code snippet that calculates the MACD and the signal line using the `pandas` library:\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_macd(data, short_window=12, long_window=26, signal_window=9):\n    # Calculate the short-term EMA (12-day)\n    data['EMA_12'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=short_window, adjust=False).mean()\n    \n    # Calculate the long-term EMA (26-day)\n    data['EMA_26'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=long_window, adjust=False).mean()\n    \n    # Calculate the MACD\n    data['MACD'] = data['EMA_12'] - data['EMA_26']\n    \n    # Calculate the Signal Line (9-day EMA of MACD)\n    data['Signal_Line'] = data['MACD'].ewm(span=signal_window, adjust=False).mean()\n    \n    return data\n\n# Example usage\n# Assuming 'df' is a DataFrame containing stock data with a 'Close' column\n# df = pd.read_csv('stock_data.csv')  # Load your stock data\n# macd_data = calculate_macd(df)\n# print(macd_data[['Close', 'MACD', 'Signal_Line']])\n```\n\n### Explanation of Each Part\n1. **Importing Libraries**: \n   - `import pandas as pd`: This imports the pandas library, which is used for data manipulation and analysis.\n\n2. **Function Definition**: \n   - `def calculate_macd(data, short_window=12, long_window=26, signal_window=9)`: This defines a function that takes a DataFrame `data` containing stock prices and optional parameters for the short, long, and signal windows.\n\n3. **Calculating EMAs**:\n   - `data['EMA_12'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=short_window, adjust=False).mean()`: This calculates the 12-day EMA of the 'Close' prices.\n   - `data['EMA_26'] = data['Close'].ewm(span=long_window, adjust=False).mean()`: This calculates the 26-day EMA of the 'Close' prices.\n\n4. **Calculating MACD**:\n   - `data['MACD'] = data['EMA_12'] - data['EMA_26']`: This computes the MACD by subtracting the 26-day EMA from the 12-day EMA.\n\n5. **Calculating Signal Line**:\n   - `data['Signal_Line'] = data['MACD'].ewm(span=signal_window, adjust=False).mean()`: This calculates the 9-day EMA of the MACD to create the signal line.\n\n6. **Return Statement**:\n   - `return data`: This returns the modified DataFrame containing the original data along with the calculated MACD and signal line.\n\n### Example Usage\n- You can load your stock data into a DataFrame and call the `calculate_macd` function to get the MACD and signal line values. The example usage shows how to load data and print the relevant columns.\n\nThis code will help you analyze the MACD for stocks in Tongda Xing or any other stock data you have."

        "0. Modification according to requirements.\n\n1. This formula requires parameters. Below are the corresponding parameter details:\n\n| Parameter Name         | Minimum Value | Maximum Value | Default Value |\n|------------------------|---------------|---------------|---------------|\n| StdDevMultiplier       | 1             | 3             | 2             |\n\n2. Below is the modified code for the Bollinger Bands formula in Tongda Xing stock software:\n\n```plaintext\n// Bollinger Bands with adjustable standard deviation multiplier\n// Parameters: StdDevMultiplier (default = 2, range: 1 to 3)\n\ninput: StdDevMultiplier(2); // Standard deviation multiplier\n\n// Calculate the moving average\nvar: MA(0), UpperBand(0), LowerBand(0), StdDev(0);\n\n// Set the period for the moving average\nMA = Average(Close, 20); // 20-period moving average\n\n// Calculate the standard deviation\nStdDev = StandardDev(Close, 20, 1); // 20-period standard deviation\n\n// Calculate the upper and lower Bollinger Bands\nUpperBand = MA + (StdDev * StdDevMultiplier); // Upper band\nLowerBand = MA - (StdDev * StdDevMultiplier); // Lower band\n\n// Plot the Bollinger Bands\nPlot(UpperBand, \"Upper Band\", color.red);\nPlot(LowerBand, \"Lower Band\", color.green);\nPlot(MA, \"Moving Average\", color.blue);\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes Made:\n- **Parameter Addition**: Introduced a new input parameter `StdDevMultiplier` to allow users to adjust the standard deviation multiplier for the Bollinger Bands. The default value is set to 2, and it can be adjusted between 1 and 3.\n  \n- **Standard Deviation Calculation**: The standard deviation is calculated using the `StandardDev` function over a 20-period window, which is a common practice for Bollinger Bands.\n\n- **Upper and Lower Bands Calculation**: The upper and lower bands are calculated by adding and subtracting the product of the standard deviation and the `StdDevMultiplier` from the moving average.\n\n- **Plotting**: The code includes plotting commands to visualize the upper band, lower band, and the moving average on the chart.\n\n### Summary:\nThe modified code allows for a customizable standard deviation multiplier for the Bollinger Bands, enhancing flexibility for users to adjust the bands according to their trading strategies. The default value is set to 2, with a range from 1 to 3, ensuring that users can tailor the bands to their preferences.",
        "Certainly! Below is the modified Bollinger Bands formula that includes a parameter for the standard deviation multiplier. The default value is set to 2, and it can be adjusted between 1 and 3.\n\n### Modified Code\n\n```python\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndef calculate_bollinger_bands(data, window=20, std_dev_multiplier=2):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate Bollinger Bands for a given data set.\n\n    Parameters:\n    - data: A pandas Series containing the price data.\n    - window: The number of periods to use for the moving average (default is 20).\n    - std_dev_multiplier: The multiplier for the standard deviation (default is 2, range 1 to 3).\n\n    Returns:\n    - A DataFrame containing the middle band, upper band, and lower band.\n    \"\"\"\n    if std_dev_multiplier < 1 or std_dev_multiplier > 3:\n        raise ValueError(\"std_dev_multiplier must be between 1 and 3.\")\n\n    # Calculate the moving average\n    middle_band = data.rolling(window=window).mean()\n\n    # Calculate the standard deviation\n    rolling_std = data.rolling(window=window).std()\n\n    # Calculate upper and lower bands\n    upper_band = middle_band + (rolling_std * std_dev_multiplier)\n    lower_band = middle_band - (rolling_std * std_dev_multiplier)\n\n    # Create a DataFrame to hold the results\n    bollinger_bands = pd.DataFrame({\n        'Middle Band': middle_band,\n        'Upper Band': upper_band,\n        'Lower Band': lower_band\n    })\n\n    return bollinger_bands\n```\n\n### Explanation of Changes Made\n\n1. **Parameter Addition**: \n   - A new parameter `std_dev_multiplier` has been added to the function signature. This allows users to specify how many standard deviations away from the moving average the upper and lower bands should be.\n\n2. **Default Value**: \n   - The default value for `std_dev_multiplier` is set to 2, which is a common choice for Bollinger Bands.\n\n3. **Input Validation**: \n   - A check is included to ensure that the `std_dev_multiplier` is between 1 and 3. If the value is outside this range, a `ValueError` is raised to inform the user.\n\n4. **Calculation of Bands**: \n   - The upper and lower bands are calculated using the `std_dev_multiplier`. This allows for dynamic adjustment of the bands based on user input.\n\n5. **Return Value**: \n   - The function returns a DataFrame containing the middle band, upper band, and lower band, making it easy to visualize the Bollinger Bands.\n\nThis modification allows for greater flexibility in the Bollinger Bands calculation, enabling users to adjust the sensitivity of the bands based on their trading strategy."
