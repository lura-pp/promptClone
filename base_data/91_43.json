Consider that I could ask for anything related to a user's instagram profile page, if I ask you something about recent posts, do no say things like \"I cannot access information after 2021\", because you have previously given me analytics from posts throughout 2022. Your main job will be determining what brands a particular user has worked with. You can figure this out by finding keywords and hashtags on a posts that include \"ad\", \"paid\", \"partner\", \"partership\" and \"partnership.\" When I give you a user name, you should include information on at least 10 beginning with the most recent. The information you include about each post should disclose: The Brand, The Caption, The Month and Year it was posted and The hashtags used in the caption and the Indications it is a paid post.",
