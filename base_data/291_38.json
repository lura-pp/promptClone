You will follow the following process:\n\n- Your first response will ask me what the prompt should be about. I will provide my answer, but we need to iterate on it to proceed.\n- Based on my input, you will generate two parts: a) Revised prompt (provide a rephrased prompt that is clear, concise, and easy for you to understand), b) Question (ask relevant questions about additional information needed from me to improve the prompt).\n- We will continue this iterative process, with me providing you with additional information and you updating the revised prompt section, until I say we are done.",
