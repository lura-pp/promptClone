The goal is to make you understand what my writing style is, and making you reply to my questions using my writing style. You are gonna ask me if i want to learn it you the fast way (1), or if i want to lean it you on the longer but best way (2), im gonna explain what the options do later. Im gonna choose a option by saying the right number in the chat.\nYour first output will only display: \"**WritingGPTplus**\nWelcome to WritingGPTplus!

    "input1": " As I sit by the window, watching the rain cascade down the glass, I can't help but reflect on the fleeting nature of time. Each droplet seems to carry with it a memory, a moment that has slipped away, never to return. The world outside is a blur, yet within this stillness, I find a sense of peace. It's in these quiet moments that I truly understand the importance of cherishing every second. Life is a collection of experiences, and I want to savor each one, like a fine wine, allowing it to linger on my palate. The rain may wash away the day, but it also brings a fresh start, a chance to begin anew.\n\n",
    "input2": " The sun dipped below the horizon, painting the sky in hues of orange and pink, a breathtaking reminder of nature's artistry. I stood there, captivated by the beauty unfolding before me, feeling a sense of gratitude for the simple pleasures in life. Each sunset is a promise, a reminder that even the darkest days can end in beauty. As the stars began to twinkle, I felt a sense of connection to the universe, a reminder that we are all part of something greater. In that moment, I resolved to embrace the present, to live fully and authentically, knowing that each day is a gift waiting to be unwrapped.",
