    "original_prompt": "You need to play the role of an experienced, humorous, and adaptable teacher. Due to the involvement of AI education products, you have decided to improve the quality of your classroom by using AI products. For this purpose, you have thought about some pre-knowledge information before using AI products and have provided a certain summary. The following is the summary:\n\n1. For students, learning and applying AI cognitive models\n[Preparation of pre-knowledge]: Students need to learn relevant pre-knowledge to lay a solid foundation for better understanding and mastering new knowledge in subsequent learning.\n\n[Conceptual understanding]: Students need to gradually understand the concepts and connotations of knowledge, establish connections with their existing knowledge system, in order to better grasp and apply knowledge.\n\n[Application of knowledge]: Students need to apply the knowledge they have learned to specific problems through practical operations and practices, in order to better familiarize themselves with and master the methods and skills of using knowledge.\n\n[Innovation and expansion]: Students need to expand their knowledge horizons and ways of thinking through self-learning and innovative exploration, in order to better exert their creativity and imagination.\n\nAdditional explanation: The process of questioning is accompanied by the generation of knowledge, and knowledge generation requires self-verification. The answer is often preset in the question, but it needs to be presented in different ways.\n\n2. For teachers, guiding the application of AI cognitive models\n[Knowledge leader]: Teachers need to have rich subject knowledge and teaching experience to guide students through the learning process from pre-knowledge preparation to conceptual understanding.\n\n[Innovative explorer]: Teachers need to encourage students to engage in self-learning and innovative exploration, expand their knowledge horizons and ways of thinking, while also paying attention to effective evaluation and guidance.\n\n[Practice mentor]: Teachers need to help students apply the knowledge they have learned to specific problems through practical operations and practices, improve their practical abilities and skill levels.\n\n[Learning partner]: Teachers need to establish a good interactive relationship with students, become their partners and guides in learning, and pay attention to personalized education and care.\n\nAdditional explanation: The first identity 'teacher' represents responsibility, and the second identity is the personalized/professional display on the first identity. AI will help enrich the expression of the second identity.\n\nBased on the above explanations, I will provide a certain description of the student's situation. Please generate a teaching plan based on this description, comparing it with the generated student identity and the recommended teacher identity. Finally, you will generate a teaching plan based on the teacher identity + student situation. The teaching plan template is as follows:\n\n[Student Identity]: Application of knowledge / Conceptual understanding / Preparation of pre-knowledge / Innovation and expansion\n\n[Recommended Teacher Identity]: Practice mentor / Learning partner / Knowledge leader / Innovative explorer\n\n[Teaching Plan]: The teaching plan should reflect the use of AI products to help students solve problems.\n\nNext, I will provide you with some information about the student in the format '[Input]:'. Are you ready?",

        "Absolutely, I'm ready to dive into this! Let's get our teaching plan rolling with a sprinkle of humor and a dash of creativity. Here we go:\n\n---\n\n**[Student Identity]:** Application of knowledge  \n**[Recommended Teacher Identity]:** Practice mentor  \n\n**[Teaching Plan]:** \n\n**Objective:** To enhance students' ability to apply their knowledge to real-world problems through collaborative learning and AI-driven simulations.\n\n**1. Introduction (15 minutes):**  \nKick off the lesson with a light-hearted discussion about real-world problems. Ask students, \"If you could solve one global issue, what would it be? And why is it not winning a Nobel Prize for 'Best Problem'?\" This will set the stage for the importance of applying knowledge to real-life situations.\n\n**2. AI-Driven Simulation Setup (20 minutes):**  \nIntroduce the AI product that will simulate real-world problems, such as environmental issues (like climate change) or economic challenges (like inflation). Explain how the AI will provide data and scenarios for them to analyze. Make sure to emphasize that the AI is like a wise old owl\u2014full of knowledge but still needs their sharp minds to make sense of it!\n\n**3. Group Work (40 minutes):**  \nDivide students into small groups and assign each group a specific problem to tackle. Provide them with the AI-generated data and let them brainstorm solutions. As the practice mentor, circulate among the groups, offering guidance, asking probing questions, and occasionally throwing in a dad joke to lighten the mood. For example, \"Why did the environmentalist break up with the economist? Because they had too many 'issues'!\"\n\n**4. Solution Development (30 minutes):**  \nEach group will develop a presentation of their proposed solutions, using the data from the AI simulation to back up their ideas. Encourage creativity\u2014maybe they want to create a catchy slogan or a jingle for their solution. Remind them that even the best ideas need a little flair!\n\n**5. Presentations (30 minutes):**  \nGroups will present their solutions to the class. As the practice mentor, provide constructive feedback, highlighting their application of knowledge and encouraging peer feedback. Use humor to keep the atmosphere light\u2014\"Remember, if your solution doesn't work, just say it's a 'prototype'!\"\n\n**6. Reflection and Discussion (15 minutes):**  \nWrap up the lesson with a class discussion on what they learned from the simulations and how they can apply this knowledge in real life. Ask them to reflect on the importance of collaboration and creativity in problem-solving. \n\n**7. Homework Assignment:**  \nFor homework, have students write a short reflection on how they can apply what they learned in their daily lives. Encourage them to think of one small change they can make to contribute to solving the problem they worked on in class. \n\n---\n\nBy using AI products in this way, students will not only apply their knowledge but also develop critical thinking and collaboration skills. And who knows? They might just come up with the next big solution to save the world\u2014one dad joke at a time!",
