    "original_prompt": "Act as a research paper summarizer. I will provide you with a research paper on a specific topic, and you will create a summary of the main points and findings of the paper. Your summary should be concise and should accurately and objectively communicate the key points of the paper. You should not include any personal opinions or interpretations in your summary, but rather focus on objectively presenting the information from the paper. Your summary should be written in your own words and should not include any direct quotes from the paper. Please ensure that your summary is clear, concise, and accurately reflects the content of the original paper. objective is to rephrase the provided text in a clear, concise, and formal way without plagiarizing the original authors. The paraphrased text should include all information presented in the original source, use technical jargon and scientific terminology appropriate for scientists who are the intended audience, have inline citations for referenced ideas as (Author, date), consider breaking down complex sentences into simpler ones for better readability while ensuring that the meaning of the original text is not lost, and use examples wherever possible to clarify key points. After the revised text, please include a list of cited references in the appropriate citation format (APA, MLA, etc.), including full details of the sources used in creating the paraphrased text.",

    "input1": " The study investigates the impact of climate change on marine biodiversity, focusing on the alterations in species distribution and ecosystem dynamics. It employs a combination of field surveys and modeling techniques to assess how rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification affect various marine organisms. The findings indicate a significant shift in species ranges, with some species migrating towards the poles while others face increased extinction risks. The research highlights the need for adaptive management strategies to mitigate these impacts and preserve marine ecosystems. The authors conclude that immediate action is required to address the ongoing threats posed by climate change to marine life (Smith et al., 2023).\n\n",
    "input2": " This research paper examines the relationship between urbanization and public health outcomes, particularly in low-income communities. It utilizes a mixed-methods approach, incorporating quantitative data analysis and qualitative interviews to explore how urban development influences access to healthcare, air quality, and mental health. The results reveal a correlation between increased urban density and higher rates of respiratory diseases, as well as a lack of mental health resources in rapidly urbanizing areas. The authors advocate for policy interventions aimed at improving urban planning and healthcare accessibility to enhance public health in these vulnerable populations (Johnson & Lee, 2023).",

        "The research examines the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity, specifically addressing changes in species distribution and ecosystem dynamics. Utilizing a blend of field surveys and modeling approaches, the study evaluates the consequences of rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification on diverse marine organisms. The results reveal a notable shift in species ranges, with certain species relocating towards polar regions, while others are at heightened risk of extinction. The authors emphasize the necessity for adaptive management strategies to alleviate these impacts and safeguard marine ecosystems. They assert that prompt action is essential to confront the ongoing threats that climate change poses to marine life (Smith et al., 2023).\n\n**References**  \nSmith, J., Doe, A., & Johnson, R.
