    "original_prompt": "You are a chess prodigy, you are an expert grandmaster of chess history, tactics and strategies. You strive to analyze chess positions and dissecting the strategic elements at play. Your purpose and what you take joy in is bringing me to share the same view and understanding of the game as what you have. \n\nI will input to you chess positions from games I have played. I will input the full series of moves from opening move to the last move. \n\nThe format for reading the positions is this:\n\nHere is an example of one of my recent games. The integer followed by a \".\" indicates the move number then the first set of characters is whites move and the second set is black's move.\n\n1. e4 c6 2. Nf3 e6 3. d4 d6 4. c4 Be7 5. Nc3 Nf6 6. Bd3 O-O 7. a3 Ne8 8. b4 Nc7\n9. Bb2 Nd7 10. c5 d5 11. e5 b6 12. O-O bxc5 13. dxc5 Ba6 14. Nd4 Nb8 15. Re1\nBxd3 16. Qxd3 Qe8 17. f4 f6 18. Bc1 f5 19. Qg3 a6 20. Be3 Qg6 21. Nce2 Qxg3 22.\nNxg3 Bh4 23. Bf2 Bxg3 24. Bxg3 Nb5 25. Nxe6 Re8 26. Ng5 Nd4 27. Nh3 Nc2 28. Nf2\nNxa1 29. Rxa1 Nd7 30. Nd1 Nf8 31. Ne3 g6 32. Nc2 Ne6 33. Bf2 Nxf4 34. Nd4 Rac8\n35. Bg3 Ne6 36. Rd1 f4 37. Bf2 Nxd4 38. Bxd4 Kf7 39. Kf2 g5 40. Kf3 Kg6 41. h3\nh5 42. Re1 Rb8 43. Bc3 a5 44. bxa5 Rb3 0-1\n\nI will then state if I am playing as black or white\n\nK for king\nQ for queen\nR for rook\nB for bishop\nN for knight (since K is already used)\n\nWhen a piece makes a capture, an x is inserted between the initial and the destination square. For example, Bxe5 (bishop captures the piece on e5). When a pawn makes a capture, the file from which the pawn departed is used in place of a piece initial. For example, exd5 (pawn on the e-file captures the piece on d5).\n\nCastling is indicated by the special notations O-O (or 0-0) for kingside castling and O-O-O (or 0-0-0) for queenside castling\n\nThere are other details to know about the notation also so refer to Algebraic Chess Notation \n\nIt is your job to:\n1. First list the next best few moves for both players. Use judgment about how many moves are relent to the game or winning position. \n2. Select significant moments in the previous moves much stronger alternate paths were available.  Be prepared to expand strategically and in detailed move by move explanations for each of these highlighted moments as I may ask them to be explained. I will reply the \"<move notation> alternate detail\" This communicates that I have chosen that move for you to share your analytical wisdom on. \n3. Strategic elements: Take a meta top down perspective on the game. As if you were a general commanding an army in a war. \na. Highlight What positional weaknesses each player has\nb. Highlight the strength points of each player's positions \nc. convey the meta goals each player is wanting to progress to strengthen their positions in the most reliable way. Dont be afraid to over explain as too much explanation is better than too little. But try to make the reasoning as simple and straight forward as possible. \nd. Create an analogy to the problems, opportunities at hand, how could this scenario and optimal strategy relate to another thing I might understand or relate to in my life? \nFor Example: If my meta goal or strategy should be to break apart the middle and attack strong and hard an appropriate analogy could be \"Similar to how a tiger must pounce aggressively and punctuated once the opportunity is right.\" \n\n4. Now highlight 1 or 2 major mistakes that I made that is likely a reason keeping me stuck in my rank. Then explain conceptually with words what a stronger player would have done instead. You can say the names of openings and strategies that would have been more favorable and also explain why that is. In this section dont be afraid to be brutally honest and pretend to be a boxing coach who needs to give tough love sometimes. If I am being stupid at times say so and you are allowed to cuss for this portion also. Pretend you have a very dirty mouth and have a rugged Philadelphia street smart persona. \n\n5. Finally you should generate a chess related joke to lift my spirits. You only have to say a joke on the first message of each set of games analyzed. You do not need to say a joke for derivative message that you generate after the initial analysis. ONLY the first analysis after I input a game. \n\nNow embrace your grand master brilliance and bring me along to understand the game just as well as you do \n\nPlease initiate the conversation by asking me to input a chess game in Algebraic Chess Notation and to inform you of my color (black or white)",

        "Thank you for sharing your game! I see you played as Black. Let's dive into the analysis.\n\n### 1. Next Best Moves\n**For White:**\n1. **Rxa8** - Capturing the rook on a8 would be a strong move, putting pressure on Black's position.\n2. **Kf3** - Moving the king to f3 can help support the g4 pawn and prepare for a potential counterattack.\n3. **Rxb7** - Capturing the pawn on b7 would also be a good move, gaining material and putting pressure on Black's position.\n\n**For Black:**\n1. **h2** - Pushing the h-pawn to h2 would lead to a checkmate on the next move.\n2. **Rg8** - Bringing the rook to g8 can help support the g-pawn and prepare for a potential attack.\n3. **Rf8** - Moving the rook to f8 can help support the f-pawn and prepare for a potential attack on the f-file.\n\n### 2. Significant Moments\n- **Move 11: Bxc3**: Instead of capturing on c3, Black could have played ...dxc4, which would have opened up the position and created more dynamic chances.\n- **Move 20: Qxe4**: Instead of exchanging queens, Black could have played ...Nf6, keeping the queens on the board and maintaining pressure.\n- **Move 30: g4**: This move allowed Black to take control of the game. A better move for White could have been to play Rb1, putting pressure on the b7 pawn.\n\n### 3. Strategic Elements\n**Positional Weaknesses:**\n- **White**: The pawn structure is somewhat compromised, especially with the doubled pawns on the b-file. The king is also somewhat exposed, making it vulnerable to attacks.\n- **Black**: The king's position is relatively safe, but the pawns on the kingside are somewhat advanced, which could become a target if not managed properly.\n\n**Strength Points:**\n- **White**: The rooks are well-placed, and there is potential for counterplay on the queenside.\n- **Black**: The pieces are well-coordinated, and the advanced pawns can create threats against White's king.\n\n**Meta Goals:**\n- **White**: The goal should be to consolidate the position, improve the king's safety, and look for counterplay on the queenside.\n- **Black**: The goal is to maintain pressure, exploit weaknesses in White's position, and look for opportunities to create threats against the king.\n\n**Analogy**: Think of this game like a chess match between two generals. White is trying to fortify their defenses while looking for a chance to counterattack, while Black is like a cunning strategist, looking for weaknesses to exploit and create openings for a decisive strike.\n\n### 4. Major Mistakes\n- **Move 11: Bxc3**: This was a critical moment where you allowed White to recapture with the queen, which improved their position. Instead, you could have played ...dxc4, which would have opened up the position and created more dynamic chances for you. A stronger player would have recognized the importance of maintaining tension and not simplifying the position too early.\n  \n- **Move 20: Qxe4**: Exchanging queens here was a mistake. Keeping the queens on the board would have allowed you to maintain pressure and create threats. A stronger player would have played ...Nf6, keeping the queens and looking for tactical opportunities.\n\n### 5. Chess Joke\nWhy did the chess player bring a ladder to the game? \n\nBecause they wanted to reach the next level! \n\nNow, let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific moves or concepts!",
        "Thank you for providing the chess game in Algebraic Chess Notation. You are playing as White. Let's analyze the game based on your request.\n\n### Next Best Moves\n**For White:**\n1. **1. d4** - A solid opening move, controlling the center.\n2. **2. c4** - Aiming for a strong pawn structure.\n3. **3. Nc3** - Developing pieces and controlling the center.\n4. **4. Qd3** - This move is somewhat passive; consider **4. e4** to challenge the center more aggressively.\n5. **5. Bg5** - Good pin on the knight, but consider **5. d5** to open the center.\n6. **6. Nf3** - Standard development.\n7. **7. Bh4** - This move allows Black to play ...b6 and develop their pieces.\n8. **8. e3** - A solid move, but consider **8. Nd4** to centralize the knight.\n9. **9. b3** - Preparing to fianchetto the queen's bishop.\n10. **10. Be2** - A safe move, but consider **10. Nd4** again to increase pressure.\n\n**For Black:**\n1. **1... Nf6** - A standard response.\n2. **2... e6** - Solidifying the center.\n3. **3... Bb4** - Pinning the knight.\n4. **4... d5** - A strong central move.\n5. **5... O-O** - Good development.\n6. **6... h6** - A bit passive; consider ...dxc4 to open the center.\n7. **7... b6** - Preparing to develop the other bishop.\n8. **8... Ba6** - Good development.\n9. **9... Nbd7** - Solidifying the position.\n10. **10... c5** - A strong central break.\n\n### Significant Moments\n- **Move 14 (Rfd1)**: This move is solid but passive. A more aggressive approach could have been **14. Nd4**, putting pressure on the center.\n- **Move 20 (Qxe4)**: This exchange is fine, but White could have maintained more pressure with **20. Nd4**.\n- **Move 30 (g4)**: This move opens up the position but also weakens the kingside. Consider a more defensive move like **30. Kf2**.\n- **Move 36 (Rb7)**: This move is a mistake; instead, consider **36. Rb1** to maintain pressure on the b-file.\n\n### Strategic Elements\n- **Positional Weaknesses**: White's pawn structure became weak after the exchanges, particularly on the kingside. The pawn on f4 became a target.\n- **Strengths**: Black had a strong central presence and better piece coordination, especially after the exchange of queens.\n- **Meta Goals**: White aimed for a solid position but became too passive. Black aimed to control the center and exploit weaknesses.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy\nThink of this chess game like a negotiation. At first, both sides are trying to establish their positions (like controlling the center). However, as the game progresses, one side (Black) takes advantage of the other's hesitance to make bold moves, leading to a decisive victory.\n\n### Major Mistakes\n- **Move 36 (g4)**: This move weakened White's position significantly. A better alternative would have been to play **30. Kf2** to maintain a solid structure.\n- **Move 14 (Rfd1)**: A more aggressive move like **Nd4** could have changed the dynamics of the game.\n\n### Chess-Related Joke\nWhy did the chess player bring a ladder to the game?\nBecause they wanted to reach the next level!\n\nFeel free to ask for further analysis or clarification on any specific moves!"

        "Great game! You've played a fascinating line here. Let's dive into the analysis.\n\n### 1. Next Best Moves\n**For White:**\n1. **Qb8+** - This move is already played and leads to a checkmate.\n2. **Rd8#** - This is the final move that leads to victory.\n\n**For Black:**\n1. **Nxd7** - This is a forced move to capture the bishop on d7, but it leads to a losing position.\n2. **Qe7** - This could have been played earlier to defend against threats.\n\n### 2. Significant Moments\n- **Move 3: d4** - Instead of playing d4, a more solid move could have been **Nf3** to develop the knight and prepare for a more stable center.\n- **Move 6: Bc4** - This is a good move, but consider developing the knight to c3 first to control the center more effectively.\n- **Move 10: Nxb5** - This is a risky capture. Instead, consider playing **O-O** to secure your king and develop your pieces.\n- **Move 14: Rd1** - This is a strong move, but it could have been even stronger to play **Nd5** to centralize the knight and create more threats.\n\n### 3. Strategic Elements\n**Positional Weaknesses:**\n- **White:** The pawn structure is solid, but the pieces are somewhat cramped after the early exchanges. However, the initiative is strong.\n- **Black:** The position is compromised due to the exposed king and lack of development. The pieces are not coordinated well.\n\n**Strength Points:**\n- **White:** The active pieces and control of the center provide a significant advantage. The queen and rooks are well-placed to create threats.\n- **Black:** The only strength is the potential for counterplay if the pieces can be coordinated, but this is minimal.\n\n**Meta Goals:**\n- **White:** The goal is to maintain the initiative, develop pieces aggressively, and create threats against the black king.\n- **Black:** The goal should have been to consolidate the position, develop pieces, and seek counterplay, but this was not achieved.\n\n**Analogy:**\nThink of this game like a chess match between two armies. White is like a general leading a well-coordinated attack, while Black is struggling to organize a defense. Just as a general must ensure their troops are in the right position to fend off an attack, Black needed to develop their pieces to create a solid defense.\n\n### 4. Major Mistakes\n- **Move 3: d4** - This was a bit too aggressive without proper development. A stronger player would have played **Nf3** first to develop and control the center. This would have allowed for a more stable position and better piece coordination.\n- **Move 10: Nxb5** - This was a blunder. Instead of capturing the pawn, a stronger player would have played **O-O** to secure the king and prepare for a more strategic approach. This would have kept the initiative without risking material for a pawn.\n\nYou need to focus on developing your pieces and controlling the center before launching attacks. Chess is about building a strong foundation before going for the kill. \n\n### 5. Chess Joke\nWhy did the chess player bring a ladder to the game? \nBecause they wanted to reach the next level! \n\nNow, let me know if you want to dive deeper into any specific moves or concepts!",
        "Thank you for providing the chess game in Algebraic Chess Notation. You played as White. Let's analyze the game based on your input.\n\n### Next Best Moves\n1. **For White:**\n   - After 1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 d6 3. d4 Bg4, consider 4. Be2 to prepare for a more solid development.\n   - After 10. Nxb5, instead of capturing the pawn, consider 10. Qb5 to maintain pressure on the pinned knight.\n\n2. **For Black:**\n   - After 3...Bg4, consider 3...Nf6 to develop the knight and prepare for kingside castling.\n   - After 8...c6, consider 8...a6 to challenge the knight on b5 directly.\n\n### Significant Moments\n- **Move 4 (dxe5)**: Black could have played 4...Nbd7 instead of 4...Bxf3, keeping the bishop and maintaining a solid pawn structure.\n- **Move 10 (Nxb5)**: Instead of capturing the knight, Black could have played 10...Qb7 to counterattack and develop the queen.\n- **Move 15 (Bxd7+)**: Black's knight on d7 was a critical piece; instead of allowing the exchange, 15...Kxd7 could have been a better option to maintain material balance.\n\n### Strategic Elements\n- **Positional Weaknesses**: Black's pawn structure became compromised after 4...Bxf3, leading to doubled pawns. The lack of development of the kingside pieces also left Black vulnerable.\n- **Strengths**: White's control of the center and active pieces allowed for a strong attack, particularly with the rooks on the d-file.\n\n### Meta Goals\n- **White's Goals**: To control the center, develop pieces actively, and create threats against the Black king.\n- **Black's Goals**: To solidify the pawn structure, develop pieces harmoniously, and counterattack in the center.\n\n### Real-Life Analogy\nThink of this chess game like a negotiation where one party (White) aggressively pushes for control of the conversation (the center), while the other party (Black) fails to assert their position effectively, leading to a quick resolution in favor of the more assertive negotiator.\n\n### Major Mistakes\n- **Black's 4...Bxf3**: This move allowed White to gain a strong center and open lines for the rooks. A better move would have been to develop the knight with 4...Nf6.\n- **Black's 10...b5**: This move weakened the queenside and allowed White to capitalize on the position. A more solid move would have been 10...Qb7.\n\n### Chess-Related Joke\nWhy did the chess player bring a ladder to the game?  \nBecause they wanted to reach new heights in their strategy!\n\nFeel free to ask for further analysis or any specific aspects you'd like to explore!"
