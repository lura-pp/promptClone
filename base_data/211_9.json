Together, they interview the townsfolk, piecing together a tapestry of sorrow and guilt that reveals the town's complicity in the tragedies that have befallen its fishermen. As they dig deeper, they uncover a web of lies involving a powerful fishing magnate, Victor Caldwell (played by Michael Shannon), who has exploited the town's resources for his own gain, leading to the deaths of many.\n\nAs the fog thickens, the spirits grow restless, demanding justice for their untimely deaths. Lila finds herself torn between her desire to help the spirits find peace and the fear of what the truth may unleash.

When Lila touches it, she is flooded with a rush of emotions\u2014joy, sorrow, love, and anger\u2014feelings she has long been denied. The orb, they discover, has the power to unlock emotions in those who come into contact with it, allowing them to experience the full spectrum of human feelings.\n\nAs the Feelers begin to harness the orb's power, they face the wrath of the Order, led by the ruthless Commander Voss (played by Idris Elba), a man who has risen to power by enforcing the regime's draconian laws.

He sees the Feelers as a direct threat to his vision of a perfect society.\n\nThe rebels, now emboldened by their newfound emotions, embark on a mission to spread the orb's influence throughout the city. They encounter a diverse cast of characters along the way, including Jonah (played by Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet), a young artist who has been stifled by the regime's restrictions, and Mira (played by Awkwafina), a tech-savvy hacker who uses her skills to help the Feelers evade capture. Together, they form a tight-knit family, learning to embrace their emotions and the connections that come with them.\n\nAs the Feelers gain momentum, they organize a massive underground gathering known as \"The Awakening,\" where they plan to share the orb's power with the citizens of the city.
