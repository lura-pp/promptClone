Lira became a symbol of hope and resilience, her story inspiring generations of animals to come. They learned that even in the face of adversity, compassion and selflessness could lead to remarkable change.\n\nAs the forest thrived, Lira continued to sing her sweet melodies, now accompanied by the joyful sounds of her friends.
