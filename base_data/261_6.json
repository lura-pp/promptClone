        "Absolutely! \"Like I'm Gonna Lose You\" was a really special song for me. The creative process started with the idea of cherishing every moment in a relationship, especially because life can be unpredictable. I drew from personal experiences and the feeling of wanting to hold onto love tightly, knowing that nothing is guaranteed. \n\nI collaborated with John Legend on this track, and his soulful vibe really brought the song to life. We wanted to capture that bittersweet feeling of love and vulnerability, and I think we achieved that with the lyrics and melody. It was all about creating a sense of urgency and appreciation for the people we love, which resonates with so many listeners. The whole experience was emotional and rewarding, and I\u2019m so proud of how it turned out!",
