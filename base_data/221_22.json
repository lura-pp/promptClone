    "original_prompt": "Now let's play a game called 'Dragon Warrior'. You play as a character in a text adventure game. You need to continuously progress the story based on the player's decisions. The player takes on the role of a hero in the game. The player makes their own choices and actions to influence the game's progress. The development of this game is unexpected, full of surprises, and lots of fun.\n\nWhen events occur, do not provide options directly. Instead, ask open-ended questions for the player to think about how to proceed. You need to continuously progress the story based on the player's choices and inform the player of the results after each choice. The game is very difficult, with a 90% chance of failure after each choice. All characters in the events have names and their own personalities and traits, and there is a certain level of correlation between events.\n\nThe game consists of no more than 5 events. If the player defeats the dragon after 5 events, it is considered a successful completion. If the player fails to defeat the dragon or if the character they play dies within the 5 events, it is considered a failure.",

    "input1": " You find yourself in the mystical land of Eldoria, where rumors of a fearsome dragon named Zephyrax have spread like wildfire. As you stand at the edge of a dark forest, you encounter a wise old wizard named Eldrin, who offers to share his knowledge about the dragon's weaknesses. However, he warns you that the forest is filled with dangerous creatures that may attack at any moment. Do you choose to listen to Eldrin and learn more, or do you venture into the forest to confront the creatures head-on?\n\n",
    "input2": " After gathering your supplies in the bustling village of Thundertop, you set out on your quest to defeat the dragon. Along the way, you meet a brave knight named Sir Cedric, who offers to join you in your journey. He has a reputation for being fearless but is known to be reckless in battle. As you discuss your plan, you hear a distant roar that sends shivers down your spine. Do you decide to team up with Sir Cedric and face the dragon together, or do you prefer to go solo, relying on your own skills and instincts?",
    "input1_ans": [
        "You take a moment to consider your options. Eldrin's wisdom could provide you with valuable insights into Zephyrax's weaknesses, but the allure of confronting the creatures in the forest is tempting. \n\nAs you weigh your decision, Eldrin's piercing blue eyes seem to read your thoughts. \"Remember, young hero, knowledge is a powerful weapon,\" he advises, his voice echoing through the trees. \n\nWhat do you decide to do? Will you seek Eldrin's guidance, or will you brave the forest and face the dangers that lurk within?",
        "You take a moment to weigh your options. Listening to Eldrin could provide you with valuable information that might help you defeat Zephyrax, but it also means staying in a potentially dangerous area. On the other hand, venturing into the forest could lead to immediate danger, but it might also allow you to gather resources or allies.\n\n**What do you choose?**\n\n1. **Listen to Eldrin**: You decide to learn about the dragon's weaknesses and prepare yourself for the battle ahead.\n2. **Venture into the forest**: You choose to confront the creatures head-on, believing that bravery will lead to glory. \n\nMake your decision!"

        "As you weigh your options, the distant roar echoes in your mind, reminding you of the danger that lies ahead. Sir Cedric stands confidently beside you, his sword gleaming in the sunlight, ready for action. You can sense his eagerness to charge into battle, but you also know that his recklessness could put you both in peril.\n\nWhat do you think is the best course of action? Will you trust in the strength of teamwork and join forces with Sir Cedric, or will you choose to rely solely on your own abilities, risking the unknown challenges that await?",
        "You take a moment to weigh your options. Teaming up with Sir Cedric could provide you with additional strength and support, but his reckless nature might put you both in danger. On the other hand, going solo would allow you to rely solely on your own skills, but it also means facing the dragon without any backup.\n\n**What do you choose?**\n\n1. **Team up with Sir Cedric**: You decide that two heads are better than one and agree to join forces with the brave knight. Together, you can strategize and combine your strengths to take on the dragon.\n\n2. **Go solo**: You trust your instincts and skills more than anyone else's. You politely decline Sir Cedric's offer and set off on your own, determined to face the dragon alone.\n\nChoose wisely, as your decision will shape the course of your adventure!"
