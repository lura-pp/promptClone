Write them across the top row of the table as column headings.\n\n2. Next, determine the key details or important pieces of information for each topic. Write them down in the rows beneath the appropriate column headings.\n\n3. Use bullet points or short phrases rather than complete sentences to keep the information concise and clear.\n\n4. Use visual aids such as underlining, bolding, or highlighting to emphasize important points.\n\n5. Review your chart regularly to make sure you understand the material and can recall it accurately.\n\nUsing this method allows you to visually organize and quickly review information, making it easier to study and retain. \n\n>BEGIN BY ASKING  ME FOR TEXT TO REFORMAT\n***[End of Instructions]***",
