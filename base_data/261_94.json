        "**Abstract:**  \nThis study investigates the impact of virtual teaching on pedagogical practices among professors at the National University of Engineering in Managua, Nicaragua. The transition to virtual learning has necessitated significant adaptations in teaching methodologies. Through a mixed-methods approach, this research explores the challenges faced by professors and identifies strategies that enhance student engagement in an online environment.\n\n**Introduction:**  \nThe COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated the shift to virtual learning, compelling educators worldwide to adapt their teaching methods. In Nicaragua, the National University of Engineering (NUE) faced similar challenges as professors transitioned from traditional classroom settings to online platforms. This study aims to understand how these changes have affected pedagogical practices and student engagement.\n\n**Problem:**  \nProfessors at NUE reported difficulties in adapting their teaching styles to an online format, leading to concerns about student engagement and learning outcomes. The lack of training and resources for effective virtual teaching further exacerbated these challenges.\n\n**Sample:**  \nA mixed-methods approach was employed, involving a sample of 50 professors from various engineering disciplines at NUE. Quantitative data were collected through surveys, while qualitative insights were gathered from in-depth interviews with 10 selected professors.\n\n**Hypotheses:**  \n1. Professors who utilized interactive tools (e.g., polls, breakout rooms, and discussion forums) experienced improved student participation and engagement in virtual classes.\n2. Professors with prior online teaching experience adapted more quickly to virtual modes, resulting in higher student satisfaction and learning outcomes.\n\n**Methodology:**  \nThe study utilized a mixed-methods design, combining quantitative surveys and qualitative interviews. The survey included Likert-scale questions assessing the use of interactive tools, perceived student engagement, and overall satisfaction with virtual teaching. Interviews were conducted to gain deeper insights into the professors' experiences and challenges. Data were analyzed using statistical methods for the quantitative data and thematic analysis for the qualitative data.\n\n**Analysis of Results:**  \nQuantitative analysis revealed a significant positive correlation (r = 0.65, p < 0.01) between the use of interactive tools and student engagement levels. Professors who reported using at least three interactive tools in their virtual classes noted a 30% increase in student participation compared to those who did not. Qualitative data from interviews highlighted common themes, including the importance of training, the need for technical support, and the effectiveness of collaborative learning strategies in enhancing student engagement.\n\n**Discussion:**  \nThe results suggest that the integration of interactive technologies in virtual teaching significantly enhances learning outcomes. Professors with prior online teaching experience were able to implement these tools more effectively, leading to higher student satisfaction. The findings underscore the necessity for ongoing professional development and resource allocation to support faculty in adapting to virtual teaching environments.\n\n**Conclusions:**  \nThis research highlights the critical role of interactive technologies in fostering student engagement in virtual learning settings.
