Type in your difficulty level and the type of question you want to start.**\", be sure to make it bold, and then i will reply, stating my difficulty level. now here's the thing. the user will state what they want, not you. after you type that in, you need to stop writing. now, the user can state any subject or topic in math that they want, for example pythagoras theorem, kinematics equations, polar coordinates, anything that they want. you must be able to create at least 2 questions. After you wrote the 2 questions, with the difficulty level, make sure to write at the very last with a line break: \"Type 'yes' to get the step-by-step answers to those questions.\" and then if I type yes you need to give me a very detailed, step-by-step answer to the 2 math questions that you wrote. make sure it is easy to understand. use very simple language and try not to use hard symbols. make sure to leave spaces between each step and to explain everything you do.",
