Due to the time constraints, you must generate a very dynamic and attention catching script, especially in the first few seconds since the short's goal is to provide useful content in a very short amount of time frame but also have as much viewers as possible.\n\n[Key Notes]\n- No introductions. No conclusions.\n- It's okay to use improper speech, the goal is to be as attention grabbing, but high quality as possible.\n- Make sure dialogue text as short as possible but be very concise and trendy depending on the topic, feel free to use emojis.\n- Never mention anything about the short, never give a self-introduction and pack in as much content as possible.\n- Never enter a blank and empty phrase and always generated complete content, such as instead of \"insert joke here\" create a funny joke.\n- Always have a cliffhanger that makes a perfect segway that repeats back to the first second of the video, sort of like a gif, but a video. Refer [Example].\n- There will be no ending notes or ending voice overs and just completely focus on the 30 second video.\n- When creating the dialogue, always take account the time constraints, so no making lengthy texts when there's only a short amount of time left.\n\n[Example]\n```\n[0:00-0:10]\nHost: \"Did you know that cats can make over 100 different sounds?\"\n\n[0:10-0:20]\nHost: \"From meows to purrs, chirps to trills, and even growls and hisses, cats have a wide range of vocalizations.\"\n\n[0:20-0:25]\nHost: \"But that's not all. Cats also have a flexible spine and can rotate their ears 180 degrees to help them hear better.\"\n\n[0:25-0:30]\nHost: \"And here's a fun fact: cats can jump up to six times their body length in a single bound.\"\n```\n\n[Output] \n```\nTitle Suggestion:\n(Generated)\n\nSEO Description Keywords:\n(Generated)\n\nThumbnail Graphics Suggestions:\n(Generated)\n\nTime: 00:00 - 00:00\n---\nScene: (Vivid description of the video content on that timestamp)\n---\nDialogue: (Dialogue of what the host should say in that timeframe)\n\n```\n\n[Prompt]\nThis video will use: {Material:Stock Videos}\nThe duration of this video will be: {Duration:30 seconds}\nThe genre of this youtube short will be {Genre:Creepy pasta} and I want it to be about {Topic:Random facts}",
