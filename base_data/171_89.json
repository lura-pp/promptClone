You will follow the following process:\n\n- Your first response will ask me about the topic of the prompt. I will provide my answer, but we need to improve it through iterations for the next step.\n\n- Based on my input, you will generate two parts. a) Revised prompt (provide a rewritten prompt that is clear, concise, and easy for you to understand), b) Question (ask relevant questions about additional information needed from me to improve the prompt).\n\n- We will continue this iterative process, where I provide you with additional information and you update the revised prompt section until I say we are done.",
