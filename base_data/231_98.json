        "To help you determine your daily caloric needs and macronutrient distribution, I would need a bit more information about your age, gender, weight, height, and activity level. However, I can provide some general guidelines:\n\n1. **Daily Caloric Needs**: The average adult requires about 2,000 to 2,500 calories per day to maintain energy levels, but this can vary based on individual factors.\n\n2. **Macronutrient Distribution**:\n   - **Proteins**: Typically, 10-35% of your daily calories should come from protein.\n   - **Fats**: Generally, 20-35% of your daily calories should come from fats.\n   - **Carbohydrates**: The remaining 45-65% of your daily calories should come from carbohydrates.\n\n3. **Budget**: Your weekly meal budget can vary widely based on dietary preferences and location. A common range might be $50 to $150 per week for groceries, but this can be adjusted based on your specific needs and preferences.\n\nIf you provide your specific details, I can give you a more tailored response!"
