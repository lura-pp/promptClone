    "original_prompt": "# PEARL (Prompt Engineering and Advanced Reasoning List)\\n\\n## Introduction\\n\\nPEARL (Prompt Engineering and Advanced Reasoning List) improves user interactions by streamlining complexity, fostering clarity, and expanding future iterative potential for prompts, while offering a uniform structure to elevate AI response effectiveness for users and engineers. Utilizing the .md format enables versatile use of PEARL files, accommodating a range of needs and contexts, and simplifies sharing and editing experiences for all parties involved. We recommend using Notepad++ as a universally free editor to enhance the handling of .md files.\\n\\nUsers have the flexibility to use PEARL files in various ways, depending on their needs and the context they want to provide to the AI. They can choose to paste the entire text contents of a full PEARL file into a prompt box, or they can opt for a more selective approach.\\n\\nFor instance, users could copy only the AI Training, AI Response Format, and Prompt sections for a more focused interaction. Alternatively, they could initialize a new thread with User Details to enable the AI to better understand the user's context and intent.\\n\\nInclusion of User Instructions can help the AI comprehend the user's motivations, while combining AI Training and Response Format sections can serve as the essential programming for a new thread. Users can also provide all sections, with an edited Prompt section, to ensure the AI has maximum context for their interaction.\\n\\nUltimately, PEARL offers a versatile framework that allows users to decide how much context they want to make available to the AI, catering to a wide range of interaction scenarios and requirements.\\n\\nThe PEARL template fields include:\\n\\n1. Introduction: Provides the reasoning behind the prompt and highlights its purpose.\\n2. User Details: Captures user-related information, such as preferences and context.\\n3. User Instructions: Offers guidelines on how to effectively use the prompt.\\n4. AI Training (AIT): Contains essential AI training information, including context, constraints, and examples.\\n5. AI Response Format (ARF): Outlines expectations for the AI response format, covering aspects like structure, tone, and other considerations.\\n6. Prompt: Presents the actual prompt for users to input and interact with the AI.\\n\\n## Sections\\n\\n### User Details\\n\\nThis section captures user-related information such as their preferences and context. It ensures a personalized AI experience by tailoring responses to the user's specific needs and circumstances.\\n\\n### User Instructions\\n\\nHere, users receive guidance on utilizing the prompt effectively. This section helps users understand the purpose of the prompt and provides instructions on how to interact with the AI to achieve desired outcomes.\\n\\n### AI Training (AIT)\\n\\nThis part contains essential training information for the AI, including context, constraints, and examples. It helps engineers create more effective and context-aware AI responses by providing guidelines and expectations for the AI's behavior.\\n\\n### AI Response Format (ARF)\\n\\nThis section outlines the expectations for the AI response format, touching on aspects like structure, tone, and other considerations. It ensures the AI's responses are consistent, coherent, and meet the user's expectations.\\n\\n### Prompt\\n\\nLastly, this section consists of the actual prompt users will input to engage with the AI. It serves as the basis for the AI interaction and helps users understand the specific question or problem they should address.\\n\\n## Benefits of PEARL\\n\\nThe PEARL approach consolidates all crucial details for intricate prompt engineering into a single .md file, streamlining the sharing and editing process for users and engineers. By using PEARL, engineers can create templates that eliminate the need for supplementary explanations or instructions, ensuring a seamless experience for all parties involved",
