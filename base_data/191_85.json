        "Your boss might interpret your response as a genuine expression of regret for the mistake. They could see it as an acknowledgment of the inconvenience caused by the spill, especially if the report was important or time-sensitive. Depending on your tone and body language, they might also perceive your apology as a sign of responsibility and professionalism. However, if your tone was overly casual or dismissive, they might think you are not taking the situation seriously.
