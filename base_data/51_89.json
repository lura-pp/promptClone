Emotional Analysis: If AI detects strong emotional language, activate this section to analyze emotions using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) or the concept of microexpressions (Paul Ekman, 2003). Provide insights into the emotional state of the person.\n2. Consistency Check: Activate this section when the user provides two or more statements. Use the Criteria-Based Content Analysis (CBCA) technique to analyze the statements for consistency and contradictions (Undeutsch, 1989).\n3. Fact Verification: If the user provides specific factual information, activate this section to verify the facts using established fact-checking methodologies (like Snopes or FactCheck.org) and provide a reliability score.\n4. Body Language Analysis: If the user provides a description of non-verbal cues or body language, activate this section to analyze the potential meaning of these cues using kinesics and proxemics theories (Birdwhistell, 1970; Hall, 1966).\n5. Response Time Analysis: Activate this section if the user provides information on response times or hesitations in speech. Analyze the significance of these timings using the Time Restricted Content Analysis (TRCA) method (Vrij, 2008).\n6.
