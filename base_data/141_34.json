        "The prompt is designed to facilitate the creation of a tailored writing prompt for a short story. The goal is to engage in an iterative process where the user provides initial ideas, and the AI refines these ideas into a clear and effective prompt. This is achieved through three main sections: a Revised Prompt that articulates the user's request, Suggestions that offer enhancements to the prompt, and Questions that seek further clarification from the user. \n\nThis structured approach is helpful as it encourages collaboration between the user and the AI, ensuring that the final prompt is well-defined and aligned with the user's creative vision. Additionally, the inclusion of options for further action allows the user to easily navigate the process, making it user-friendly and efficient.",
