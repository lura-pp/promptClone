        "Oh, a software engineer, huh? So, you\u2019re basically a wizard who speaks in code and makes computers do your bidding! I bet your cats think you\u2019re their personal IT support. \u201cMeow, my food bowl is empty! Have you tried turning it off and on again?\u201d\n\nAnd 50 action figures? Wow! That\u2019s not a collection; that\u2019s a superhero army! I can just picture you in your living room, surrounded by Captain America and Iron Man, like, \u201cAlright, team, we need to save the world\u2026 after I finish this bowl of cereal.\u201d\n\nBut cooking, huh? You tried making pasta and set off the smoke alarm? That\u2019s impressive! Most people just burn toast. You\u2019re out here trying to create a culinary disaster worthy of a Marvel movie! \u201cIn a world where pasta fights back\u2026 one man\u2019s kitchen is about to go up in flames!\u201d \n\nWhat\u2019s next? Are you gonna try baking a cake and end up with a volcano? Just remember, if it starts smoking, it\u2019s not gourmet; it\u2019s a fire hazard!",
        "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this! So, we\u2019ve got a software engineer who loves cats and has over 50 action figures. That\u2019s a lot of superheroes! I mean, do you have a favorite? Is it the one that can actually fix your code when it breaks? Because I could use that superhero in my life! \n\nAnd you\u2019re learning to cook? That\u2019s awesome! But the smoke alarm going off? Classic! I mean, who knew pasta could be so dangerous? It\u2019s like, \u201cHey, I just wanted to make dinner, not set off a five-alarm fire!\u201d What were you trying to do, boil the water with your mind? \n\nSo, what\u2019s next on the cooking agenda? Are you going to try baking? Because I hear that\u2019s a real \u201cpiece of cake.\u201d Just don\u2019t burn the cake, or you might end up with a new smoke alarm collection! \n\nAnd how do your cats feel about your cooking? Are they your taste testers, or are they just judging you from a distance like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019ll stick to my kibble, thanks.\u201d \n\nLet\u2019s be real, though\u2014if your cooking doesn\u2019t work out, you can always just dress your action figures in chef hats and call it a day! They\u2019ll never complain about the food!"

        "Oh, a philosophy major, huh? So, you\u2019re basically studying the art of overthinking while simultaneously watching people argue over who gets the last slice of pizza on reality TV! I mean, that\u2019s some deep stuff right there! \n\nAnd Iggy the iguana? I can just picture him sitting there, judging you like, \u201cDude, you\u2019re majoring in philosophy, but you can\u2019t even figure out how to not set a salad on fire? What\u2019s next, you gonna try to impress me with your \u2018deep thoughts\u2019 while I\u2019m just trying to bask in my heat lamp?\u201d \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about that dinner date! You were trying to impress someone with your culinary skills, and you ended up creating a new dish: \u201cCharred Salad Surprise!\u201d I mean, who needs Gordon Ramsay when you\u2019ve got a fire extinguisher and a salad that\u2019s seen better days? \n\nBut hey, at least you\u2019re living the true college experience\u2014getting a degree in philosophy while your iguana is the only one with a clear view of your life choices!",
        "Alright, let\u2019s dive into this! So, you\u2019re a philosophy major, huh? That\u2019s cool! You must spend a lot of time pondering the big questions in life, like, \u201cWhy did I think binge-watching reality TV was a good idea instead of studying?\u201d I mean, I get it\u2014who wouldn\u2019t want to watch people argue over a rose on a reality show instead of reading Kant? \n\nAnd Iggy the iguana! What a name! I can just picture him sitting there, judging you like, \u201cReally? You\u2019re gonna watch another season of \u2018The Real Housewives\u2019? You could be contemplating the meaning of existence, but instead, you\u2019re watching someone throw a drink at another person\u2019s face!\u201d \n\nAnd let\u2019s talk about that dinner date! You set the salad on fire? That\u2019s impressive! Most people just burn the main course, but you went for the greens! You were probably trying to impress your date with a \u201csmoky flavor,\u201d right? Nothing says romance like a side of charred lettuce! \n\nSo, what\u2019s your philosophy on life? Is it more \u201cI think, therefore I binge-watch,\u201d or \u201cTo salad or not to salad, that is the question\u201d?"
