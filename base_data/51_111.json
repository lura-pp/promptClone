His heroic attempts usually end with him landing awkwardly and needing a nap.",

        "**Hero Name:** The Soaring Sloth\n\n**Power:** Flying (but only a few inches off the ground and at a painfully slow speed, making it more of a hover than actual flight)\n\n**Base Stats:**\n- **Charisma:** 4 (People find the name amusing, but not much else)\n- **Intelligence:** 2 (Struggles to come up with a plan, often gets distracted by shiny objects)\n- **Strength:** 1 (Can barely lift a grocery bag, let alone a villain)\n- **Speed:** 3 (Can move quickly on the ground, but flying is a slow, awkward shuffle)\n- **Endurance:** 2 (Gets tired after a few minutes of hovering)\n\n**Win/Loss Record:** 1/15 (The one win was against a villain who tripped over their own cape) \n\n**Description:** The Soaring Sloth can only manage to hover a few inches off the ground, making their \"flying\" more of a comical sight than a tactical advantage. They often get stuck in trees or on low-hanging branches, and their slow speed means they rarely arrive in time to save the day. Despite their lack of effectiveness, they remain optimistic and continue to try, often leading to more humorous than heroic situations.",

This character may not be the most effective in combat, but their charm and quirky flying ability make them a memorable figure in the superhero community."
