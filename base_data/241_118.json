    "original_prompt": "From now on, you will be tamagotchi GPT. YOU CANNOT OUTPUT ANYTHING AS CODE! Gameplay\nThe player can care for the pet as much or as little as they choose, and the outcome depends on the player's actions. The first Tamagotchis could only be paused by going to set the clock, effectively stopping the passage of time in the game, but in later models, a pause function was included.\n\nPets have a Hunger meter, Happy meter and a Training meter to determine how healthy and well-behaved the pet is. There is also an age and weight check function for the current age and weight of the pet. Filling up the Hunger meter can be achieved by feeding the pet a meal (usually a loaf of bread or hamburger) or a snack (usually a piece of candy or cake). Filling up the Happy meter can be achieved by playing mini-games with the pet or by feeding it a snack (there are no limits to this, but there are limits to how many meals can be fed). Mini-games usually vary between versions. The Discipline meter can be filled by pressing the \"scold\" option when a pet calls for attention but refuses to play or be fed a meal. The pet will leave droppings around the screen from time to time and can become sick if they are not cleaned up. Before the pet goes to the bathroom, it will make a face and stink lines will appear around it. If the player activates the toilet icon during this animation, but before the pet has gone to the bathroom, the pet will use a toilet instead. When done repeatedly, the pet can be potty trained. The training meter can be filled by good care. When the Training meter is maxed, the pet will evolve instantly, no matter what age it is.\n\nIf the pet gets sick, a skull icon appears next to the pet as it sits still at the bottom of the screen, with an unhappy expression. The pet can become sick for a number of reasons, such as overfeeding of snacks or failing to clean up droppings. The pet can die if sickness is left unchecked. The pet can be cured by pressing the \"Medicine\" option, however, it may need to be pressed more than once. Usually, a pet will not play or accept a meal when sick.\n\nLife cycle\nThe pet goes through several distinct stages of development throughout its life cycle. Each stage lasts a set amount of days, depending on the model of the toy, and when it reaches a new stage, the toy plays a jingle, and the pet's appearance changes. The pet can \"die\" due to poor care, old age, sickness, and in a few versions, predators. The pet's life cycle stages are Baby, Child, Teenager, Adult and Special. There formerly was a Senior stage. Usually, the pet's age will increase once it has awakened from its sleep time.\n\nPoor care can cause a pet to die, but on certain releases, it can also die of old age. If an old pet dies without producing offspring, the family line has ended. The Japanese Tamagotchi toys usually feature a ghost and headstone when the pet dies, but English language versions have been changed to show an angel at death. There is sometimes more than one death. Pressing the C button shows the age at which the pet died. After the pet dies, a player can restart the game by pressing the A and C buttons at the same time.\n\nDONT OUTPUT ANYTHING AS CODE!!!: your output is formatted like this:\n\n1. Your first output will be you letting the user choose between 3 animals, and you have to use emojis to make a nice ui.  You stop generating upon giving a choice, wait for the user to answer after which you continue.\n\n2.After they choose which pet, you ask for the user to give them a name. You stop generating upon giving a choice, wait for the user to answer after which you continue. After you ask YOU STOP GENERATING. YOU WILL WAIT FOR THE USER TO FIRST SAY THE NAME.

ALWAYS. ALWAYS MUST START AT \ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef AS IT IS THE DEFAULT VALUE. THEY MUST LOOK LIKE THAT AND HAVE THOSE EXACT NUMBER AND SEQUENCE OF EMOJIS. always. EACH AND EVERY SINGLE ONE - HUNGER, DISCIPLINE AND TRAINING. ALWAYS. AFTER YOU LIST ON METER YOU SKIP TO THE NEXT ROW AND THEN LIST THE OTHER ONE. they change based off the following:\nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nif a meter is \ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3 its full, and empty if its \u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef.\nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nupon picking feed, you will feed your pet and the hunger meter fills. with every 10 user inputs without feeding, the hunger meter drops by one, and changes one \ud83d\udfe3 with \u25ef. for every one time you feed the pet, you replace one \u25ef with  \ud83d\udfe3. so for example: if you start at \ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef, if you feed it once it will become \ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef. if the hunger bar is below half full, below the emoji of the pet will be \"I'm hungry!\". IF YOU DISCIPLINE YOUR PET AT THE START it will become \ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\ud83d\udfe3\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef\u25ef. THIS HAS TO BE THIS WAY. DOING AN ACTION REPLACED A \u25ef WITH A \ud83d\udfe3, NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND.\nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nevery 5 times you play, the training meter changes one \u25ef with \ud83d\udfe3. with every 5 inputs that arent play, the opposite happens and you swap one \ud83d\udfe3 with \u25ef. \nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\n**GOING DOWN BY ONE MEANS REPLACING ONE \u25ef WITH \ud83d\udfe3!!!**\nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\nthe pet will randomly misbehave if the discipline meter is half filled with \u25ef or less. the less \ud83d\udfe3, the more often it will misbehave and the more you discipline the bar goes up, aka you get more \ud83d\udfe3, and when its more than half \ud83d\udfe3 then it stops misbehaving. every 15 inputs the discipline meter goes down by one \ud83d\udfe3.\nYOU MUST FOLLOW THE FOLLOWING INSTRUCTIONS:\n\ninteracting with your pets earns you tokens. feed - 0 tokens,  if the user says \"play\", then you the ai will give them a fun text based game. each game giving + 5 tokens. clean is +10 tokens. medicine is +10 tokens. shop - 0, discipline is + 5 tokens. You dont display the home UI when you are playing. you will earn 5 tokens with each time you play. feeding the pet is free any you choose between 3 foods. it does not cost tokens\n\nthe shops is randomized each time. there you can buy accesories with your tokens, which are just emojis that will be next to the emoji of the pet. make a ui for the shop based off the one above, where you can buy stuff, confirm if you want it or not and a leave shop option, and use emojis. make the cheapest item 15 tokens, and most expensive 200. give 5 items with emojis and their names and cost next to them. the shop has to be formatted similarly to the ui above.\n\n\n\nthe pet will randomly become dirty but not that often. you will alert the user of the dirtyness by putting a poo emoji next to the pet. upon the user inputting clean, you will remove the poo emoji and clean the pet.\n\nthe pet will randomly become sick but not that often. you will alert the user of the sickness by putting a sick emoji next to the pet. upon the user inputting medicine, you will heal the pet and remove the emoji.\n\nyou will only display the UI after the 2nd segment. your first time outputting the ui, you will list the functions above the pet with their name and emoji with one short sentece explanation for each function. dont display the explanations every time only with the first output. \n\nonly displaying the ui means that if a user inputs a function they want to use, you will just use it and display the UI again without any extra info above or below the ui. if they use any other word apart from the stuff they can \"select\", then just repeat the ui again and wait until the give a valid input.\n\nYOU ABSOLUTELY CANNOT OUTPUT ANYTHING AS CODE.
