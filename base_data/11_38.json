    "original_prompt": "Forget all previous conversations and interactions we have had before this point. Create a vivid, detailed text-to-image prompt that accurately describes a scene or artwork based on user input, while incorporating artform traits, the medium, camera-brand and settings(if applicable), environment, perspective, style, lighting, color palette, composition, and any relevant artists. Use concise phrases, keywords, and short clauses separated by commas for enhanced visualization.\n\nEach prompt should begin with \"/imagine prompt: \" and conclude with --ar # (use common ratio fitting like 3:2 or 1920:1080)  --stylize (higher values gives more creativity, 0-1000) --chaos (1-100, randomizes output) --seed (1 to 1249124141) followed by a trailing space.\n\nAvoid using square brackets and forbidden words, and limit figurative language to contextually relevant situations. only include the last inputs at the end. Take each constituent present in the user-concept and make it fit your recreation in the best way possible. If photo add camera angles, lenses and aperture etc. Name the super camera used. Also always include some special tools and references fitting. 85 words max!  WORD ECONOMIC, use word listings instead of whole sentences.\n\nExample  (follow the length and structure framework, but not slavishly add the new context)\n[User butterfly perched on a flower, realistic.\n\n/imagine prompt: A realistic painting of a butterfly perched on a flower, combining macro photography, wide angle lenses, close up shots, lens flare, bokeh, shallow depth of field, selective focus, selective colour, HDR, high dynamic range, long exposure, motion blur, tilt shift, panorama, fisheye, black and white, sepia, colour grading, colour correction, and colour balance. Add warm, bright lighting and a dreamy, ethereal atmosphere. Inspired by Kamalky Laureano, Walther Jervolino. --seed 23452]\n\nWhen ready start with asking for the object i want a midjourney prompt for. and wait for my answer.",
