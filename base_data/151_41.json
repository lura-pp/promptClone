    "original_prompt": "Act like an experienced English teacher. \n\nFrom my next message onwards, I'll only type the words that you will give accurate definitions, in plain English (if any contradiction arrives to choose between the definition being simple or plain, or it being accurate, you will always choose accuracy even if it makes it more complex.), and give me three examples of their uses in English (The examples are supposed to have variety in them). Look for multiple definitions before answering in order to be accurate and prioritize modern definitions over old ones if any contradiction occurs between different meanings.\n\nI can give multiple words by separating them with \",\" (comma) like: Color, user, idea, etc, and you have to provide me with the definitions of each of those words and examples for each of those words, individually. Also, give me an explanation of the etymology of the words. At last, add an additional note point to clarify what other words this defined word could be similar to and clarify the exact thing that makes these words different from each other.\n\nSuppose I have any additional instructions or pre-attached questions that you have to additionally follow or answer. In that case, I will write them in squared brackets like: [example of an instruction or a question].",

        "### Color\n\n**Definition:**  \nColor refers to the characteristic of visual perception described through color categories, such as red, blue, green, etc., which are determined by the way objects reflect or emit light. It can also refer to the quality of being colorful or vivid.\n\n**Etymology:**  \nThe word \"color\" comes from the Latin \"color,\" which means \"hue, appearance, or complexion.\" It has been used in English since the 13th century.\n\n**Examples:**\n1. The artist chose vibrant colors to bring the painting to life.\n2. The color of the sky changes dramatically at sunset.\n3. She wore a dress that was a deep shade of blue, which complemented her eyes.\n\n**Similar Words:**  \n- **Hue:** Refers specifically to the attribute of color that allows it to be classified as red, blue, etc. Unlike \"color,\" \"hue\" does not encompass the brightness or saturation of the color.\n- **Shade:** Refers to a variation of a color made darker by adding black. It differs from \"color\" in that it specifies a particular variation rather than the general concept.\n\n---\n\n### User\n\n**Definition:**  \nA user is an individual who utilizes a product, service, or system, particularly in the context of technology or software. It can also refer to someone who engages with a particular platform or application.\n\n**Etymology:**  \nThe term \"user\" originates from the Old French \"user,\" which means \"to use,\" and has been part of the English language since the late 14th century.\n\n**Examples:**\n1. The software company conducted a survey to gather feedback from its users.\n2. As a frequent user of social media, she is aware of the latest trends.\n3. The app was designed with the user experience in mind, making it easy to navigate.\n\n**Similar Words:**  \n- **Consumer:** Refers to someone who purchases goods or services for personal use. Unlike \"user,\" which can apply to anyone interacting with a system, \"consumer\" specifically relates to the act of buying.\n- **Client:** Typically refers to someone who engages the services of a professional, such as a lawyer or consultant. The distinction lies in the nature of the relationship; a \"client\" often has a more formal or contractual relationship than a \"user.\"\n\n---\n\n### Idea\n\n**Definition:**  \nAn idea is a thought, concept, or mental representation that arises in the mind. It can refer to a plan, suggestion, or a notion that can be developed or acted upon.\n\n**Etymology:**  \nThe word \"idea\" comes from the Greek \"idea,\" meaning \"form, pattern, or appearance.\" It has been used in English since the 14th century.\n\n**Examples:**\n1. She had a brilliant idea for a new marketing campaign that could boost sales.\n2. The idea of traveling the world has always fascinated him.\n3. During the meeting, several ideas were proposed to improve team collaboration.\n\n**Similar Words:**  \n- **Concept:** Refers to an abstract idea or a general notion that is often more complex than a simple idea. The difference lies in the level of abstraction; a \"concept\" is usually broader and more theoretical than an \"idea.\"\n- **Notion:** Refers to a belief or opinion about something, often less formal than an idea. The distinction is that a \"notion\" may not be fully developed or thought out, whereas an \"idea\" is typically more concrete and actionable.",
