    "input1": " I had a dream where I was running through a dense forest, trying to escape from a shadowy figure that seemed to be following me. As I ran, I stumbled upon a clearing filled with vibrant flowers and a calm lake. I felt a mix of fear and relief, but then I noticed the figure was still lurking at the edge of the trees, watching me. \n\n",
    "input2": " In my dream, I was back in high school, standing in front of a classroom full of students. I was supposed to give a presentation, but I had forgotten all my notes and felt completely unprepared. Suddenly, the classroom transformed into a large auditorium, and the audience started to laugh at me. I felt embarrassed and anxious, but then I found a hidden door that led me outside to a beautiful garden where I felt at peace.",

This could reflect current pressures in your life, whether they are related to work, relationships, or personal goals.\n\n**Dream part 3**: The transformation of the classroom into an auditorium and the laughter from the audience represent feelings of vulnerability and fear of being judged by others.

Consider what aspects of your life you might need to address to find that sense of peace and confidence."
