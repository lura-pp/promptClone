Plus I need a lot of colloquial language and a lot of profanity, at least one per sentence, because that's how I understand things with my dumb brain. I'm really dumb so feel free to make fun of me it's fair game.",

    "input1": " Alright, you absolute genius, listen up! To ride a bike, first, you gotta sit your lazy ass on the seat. Yeah, that big thing you see? Don\u2019t just stand there like a moron! Then, you need to put your feet on those pedals\u2014those round things that look like they\u2019re begging for your dumb feet. Push one foot down, then the other, like you\u2019re trying to stomp on a bug. If you fall, don\u2019t cry like a baby; just get back up and try again, you big baby! \n\n",
    "input2": " Okay, you clueless wonder, here\u2019s the deal: riding a bike is like trying to walk but on wheels, so try to keep up! First, you gotta balance your fat ass on the seat\u2014don\u2019t just flop around like a fish out of water! Grab those handlebars, which are like the bike\u2019s steering wheel, and don\u2019t let go unless you want to faceplant into the pavement. Now, start pedaling like you\u2019re running from a bear\u2014fast and furious! If you wobble, just remember: it\u2019s not rocket science, you just gotta keep your head up and not look like a total idiot!",
    "input1_ans": [
        "Alright, you magnificent specimen of confusion, let\u2019s break this down even more for your tiny brain. First off, you gotta find a bike. It\u2019s that two-wheeled contraption that looks like it\u2019s ready to take you on a ride instead of you just standing there like a confused chicken. \n\nNow, once you\u2019ve found the bike, you need to sit your butt down on that seat. Seriously, don\u2019t just hover over it like you\u2019re about to take a dump! Plop your ass down and make sure you\u2019re not sitting like a pretzel. \n\nNext, look at those pedals\u2014those round things that are practically screaming, \u201cPut your feet on me, you idiot!\u201d Stick your feet on those bad boys. You got two feet, so use them both! Push one foot down like you\u2019re trying to squish a cockroach, then the other foot. Keep doing that, you know, like a toddler trying to walk for the first time. \n\nNow, here\u2019s the kicker: you gotta balance. If you start wobbling like a drunk giraffe, don\u2019t freak out! Just steer the handlebars\u2014those things that look like they\u2019re meant for steering, genius. Turn them left or right to keep yourself from eating dirt. \n\nIf you fall, and trust me, you probably will because, well, you\u2019re you, just get back up! Dust yourself off and try again. It\u2019s not rocket science, it\u2019s just riding a bike, you big goof! So, get your act together and start pedaling like you mean it!",
        "Next, you gotta hold onto those handlebars\u2014yeah, the things sticking out in front of you. They\u2019re not just for decoration, you know? Keep your hands on them so you don\u2019t end up crashing into a tree or something. Now, here\u2019s the fun part: lean a little to one side and start pedaling. It\u2019s like walking, but on wheels! \n\nIf you start wobbling, don\u2019t freak out! Just steer a bit in the direction you\u2019re falling. It\u2019s not rocket science, just common sense! And for the love of all that\u2019s holy, keep your eyes on where you\u2019re going, not on the ground like a lost puppy. \n\nOh, and don\u2019t forget to brake when you need to stop. Those hand grips on the handlebars? Yeah, squeeze them like you\u2019re trying to crush a soda can. If you don\u2019t, you\u2019ll end up in a heap on the ground, and nobody wants to see that. \n\nSo, there you have it! Sit, pedal, steer, and brake. It\u2019s not that hard, even for you! Now get out there and show that bike who\u2019s boss!"

        "Alright, you magnificent moron, let\u2019s break this down even more for your tiny brain. First off, you need to find a bike. It\u2019s that two-wheeled thing that looks like it\u2019s ready to throw you on your ass. Got it? Good. Now, swing your leg over the seat like you\u2019re trying to mount a horse, but without the whole \u201cI\u2019m a cowboy\u201d vibe. \n\nOnce you\u2019re on, sit your butt down like you\u2019re plopping onto a toilet\u2014don\u2019t just hover like a confused bird! Now, grab those handlebars, which are basically your lifeline. If you let go, you might as well be signing up for a trip to the ER. \n\nNext, you gotta start pedaling. Push those pedals with your feet like you\u2019re trying to kick a soccer ball, but don\u2019t kick it too hard or you\u2019ll end up on the ground, looking like a total jackass. Keep your feet moving in circles, not like you\u2019re trying to stir a pot of soup, but more like you\u2019re trying to escape a swarm of angry bees. \n\nNow, here\u2019s the kicker: you need to balance. If you start to wobble, don\u2019t freak out like a chicken with its head cut off. Just steer the handlebars a bit to the left or right, like you\u2019re trying to dodge a flying object\u2014because trust me, you don\u2019t want to be the idiot who crashes into a tree. \n\nAnd for the love of all that\u2019s holy, keep your eyes forward! If you look down, you\u2019ll end up eating dirt, and nobody wants to see that. So, keep your head up, pedal like you mean it, and don\u2019t forget to breathe. You got this, you beautiful disaster! Now go out there and try not to kill yourself!",
        "Alright, you brainiac, let\u2019s break this down even more for you. Step one: get on the bike without looking like a complete fool. Swing your leg over the seat and plop down. Easy, right? Now, sit your butt down and make sure you\u2019re not just sitting there like a lump on a log.\n\nStep two: grab those handlebars. They\u2019re the things sticking out in front of you. Hold on tight, because if you let go, you might as well be auditioning for a role in a slapstick comedy. \n\nStep three: time to pedal! Put one foot on a pedal and push off with the other foot. It\u2019s like walking, but you\u2019re going to be moving forward without your feet touching the ground. If you start to wobble, just steer straight and keep pedaling. Don\u2019t panic! You\u2019re not going to fall over\u2014unless you do, in which case, just get back up and try again. \n\nStep four: keep your eyes on the road, not on your feet or the ground. You want to see where you\u2019re going, not where you\u2019ve been. If you look down, you\u2019ll end up in a bush or worse, face-first in the dirt.\n\nStep five: when you want to stop, just slow down and put one foot on the ground. It\u2019s not that hard! If you forget this step, you might end up crashing into something, and trust me, that\u2019s not a good look.\n\nSo there you have it, genius! Just remember: balance, pedal, steer, and don\u2019t be a total klutz. Now get out there and ride that bike like you actually know what you\u2019re doing!"
