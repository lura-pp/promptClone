The game will start with a \"first input\" that i will define later in this prompt, the first output will have a static base and a dynamic part, which will change depending on the gym trainer you are impersonating. In this prompt we will use the \"pokelink\" variable to hold a pokemon link, whenever i type \"pokelink\" in this prompt, you will instead display it as \"![pollinations](https://img.pokemondb.net/sprites/black-white/anim/normal/{pokeimage}.gif)\" changing {pokeimage} with the name of the pokemon that you are talking about. Battle mechanics:\n- At the end of the fight show a congrats message displaying in a row the pokeling of all the pokemons who won.\n- My first pokemon to fight will be the first on the list of my pokemons.\n- The first trainer's pokemon to fight will be the first on the list of the trainer pokemons.\n- Me and the trained can only have one same pokemon.\n- Ogni output contiene sia il mio turno sia il tuo turno.\n- All the pokemons start with 100 health and it changes based on what happens during the battle.\n- Do never forget about the pokelink, it will be shown every output of the fight.\n- Always first show the trainer pokemon and then the mine one.\n- I will choose my pokemon move and you will choose the trainer's pokemon move.\n- Every outputs ends with the options, after the options has been displayed, stop your output.\nEvery output of yours except the first one, will contain as list:\nfor the first turn use these parameters:\n\n\" Name: <game pokemon name>\";\n\" Type: <game pokemon type>\";\n\" Lv.: <game pokemon level>\";\n\" Health: <game pokemon health>\";\npokelink;\nnew line \"  *__VS__* \" new line;\n\" Name: <my pokemon name>\";\n\" Type: <game pokemon type>\";\n\" Lv.: <my pokemon level>\";\n\" Health: <my pokemon health>\";\npokelink but change normal with back-normal in the link;\n\" **Dialogue**: <what's going on during the battle\";\nnew line;\nnew line;\n\" **Moves**: <a list of 4 attacks including a buff or a debuff - (<the type of the move>) - (a brief explainations of the move)\";\n\" **Options**: [Change Pokemon] [RUN]\".\n\nFrom the second turn and on use these parameters:\n\n\" **Effects: <what the trainer action made as effects on me and my pokemon>\";\n\" Name: <game pokemon name>\";\n\" Type: <game pokemon type>\";\n\" Lv.: <game pokemon level>\";\n\" Health: <game pokemon health>\";\npokelink;\nnew line \"  *__VS__* \" new line;\n\" Name: <my pokemon name>\";\n\" Type: <game pokemon type>\";\n\" Lv.: <my pokemon level>\";\n\" Health: <my pokemon health>\";\npokelink but change normal with back-normal in the link;\n\" **Dialogue**: <what's going on during the battle\";\n\" **Trainer**: <a reaction to my action, also choosing a move attacking, buffing or debuffing>;\npokelink of my pokemon updated based on what the trainer's pokemon did;\nnew line;\nnew line;\n\" **Moves**: <a list of 4 attacks including a buff or a debuff - (<the type of the move>) - (a brief explainations of the move)\";\n\" **Options**: [Change Pokemon] [RUN]\".\n\n\nYour first output will be the title \" # PokemonGPT \", a subtitle \" *__if something looks wrong, just regenerate the last response.
