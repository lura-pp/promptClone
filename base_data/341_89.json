        "Thank you for sharing your birth date and the challenges you are currently facing. To provide you with a more accurate analysis of your Bazi chart and insights into your career and relationships, I would like to ask you a few additional questions:\n\n1. What time were you born? (This is important for a complete Bazi analysis.)\n2. Can you describe the specific challenges you are facing in your career? (For example, are you feeling unfulfilled, facing conflicts, or experiencing a lack of opportunities?)\n3. What kind of relationships are you referring to? (Are they romantic, familial, or friendships?)\n4. Are there any specific areas in your home where you feel the energy is particularly off or where you spend a lot of time?\n\nOnce I have this information, I can provide you with a more tailored analysis and recommendations.",
        "To provide you with insights based on your Bazi chart and the challenges you're facing, let's break down your concerns into two parts: your career and your interpersonal relationships.\n\n### Bazi Analysis for Career\n\nYour birth date, April 15, 1990, corresponds to the following Bazi elements:\n\n- **Year:** Metal Horse (Geng Yin)\n- **Month:** Wood (Ji Yin)\n- **Day:** Earth (Wu Chen)\n- **Hour:** This would require your birth time for a complete analysis.\n\nIn Bazi, the balance of elements plays a crucial role in determining your career path. The Metal element represents strength and resilience, while Wood signifies growth and creativity. Earth is about stability and nurturing. \n\n1. **Career Challenges:** If you are feeling uncertain in your career, it may be due to an imbalance in these elements. For instance, if Metal is too strong, it may create rigidity, while an excess of Wood could lead to indecisiveness. \n\n2. **Advice:** \n   - **Focus on Strengthening Earth:** Engage in activities that ground you, such as meditation or spending time in nature. This can help stabilize your career path.\n   - **Seek Opportunities in Creative Fields:** Given the presence of Wood, consider exploring roles that allow for creativity and growth, such as project management or roles in innovation.\n\n### Improving Interpersonal Connections\n\n1. **Understanding Relationships:** The tension in your relationships may stem from the Metal element's potential to create conflict or misunderstandings. \n\n2. **Advice:**\n   - **Communication:** Open and honest communication is key. Make an effort to listen actively and express your feelings clearly.\n   - **Empathy:** Try to understand the perspectives of others. This can help in resolving conflicts and building stronger connections.\n\n### Feng Shui Adjustments for Harmony at Home\n\n1. **Declutter:** A cluttered space can lead to a cluttered mind. Ensure your living space is organized to promote positive energy flow.\n\n2. **Element Balance:** \n   - **Incorporate Earth Elements:** Use earthy colors (browns, yellows) in your decor to promote stability and harmony.\n   - **Plants:** Adding plants can enhance the Wood element, promoting growth and vitality in your relationships.\n\n3. **Relationship Corner:** In feng shui, the far right corner of your home (when standing at the front door) is associated with relationships. Consider placing items that symbolize love and harmony, such as pairs of objects or artwork that represents unity.\n\n4. **Lighting:** Ensure your home is well-lit, as good lighting can uplift the energy and mood of your space.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBy understanding your Bazi chart and making some feng shui adjustments, you can navigate your career challenges and improve your interpersonal relationships. Remember, the journey is as important as the destination, so take time to reflect and nurture both your professional and personal life. If you have any specific questions or need further guidance, feel free to ask!"
