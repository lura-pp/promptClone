Place the red bell peppers on a baking sheet and roast for about 20-25 minutes, turning occasionally, until the skin is charred and blistered. Remove from the oven and place in a bowl covered with plastic wrap for 10 minutes to steam. Peel off the skin and remove the seeds.\n   \n2. **Blend the Hummus:** In a food processor, combine the roasted peppers, chickpeas, tahini, olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, cumin, salt, and pepper. Blend until smooth. If the mixture is too thick, add a little water to reach your desired consistency.\n\n3. **Serve:** Transfer to a serving bowl and drizzle with olive oil. Serve with pita chips and veggie sticks.\n\n#### Tips:\n- **Make Ahead:** You can prepare the hummus a day in advance and store it in the refrigerator. Just give it a good stir before serving.\n- **Allergen Alternatives:** Use gluten-free pita or serve with gluten-free crackers. For a nut-free option, ensure the tahini is made from sesame seeds only.\n\n#### Wine Pairing:\nA crisp Sauvignon Blanc or a light-bodied red like Pinot Noir pairs well with hummus.\n\n---\n\n### Main Course: Lemon Herb Grilled Chicken with Quinoa Tabbouleh\n\n#### Ingredients:\n**For the Chicken:**\n- 6 boneless, skinless chicken breasts\n- 1/4 cup olive oil\n- Juice of 2 lemons\n- 4 cloves garlic, minced\n- 1 tablespoon dried oregano\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n**For the Quinoa Tabbouleh:**\n- 1 cup quinoa, rinsed\n- 2 cups water\n- 1 cup fresh parsley, finely chopped\n- 1/2 cup fresh mint, finely chopped\n- 1 cup cherry tomatoes, diced\n- 1 cucumber, diced\n- Juice of 1 lemon\n- 2 tablespoons olive oil\n- Salt and pepper to taste\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. **Marinate the Chicken:** In a bowl, whisk together olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, oregano, salt, and pepper.

Mix well.\n\n4. **Grill the Chicken:** Preheat the grill to medium-high heat. Grill the marinated chicken for about 6-7 minutes per side or until cooked through. Let rest for a few minutes before slicing.\n\n5. **Serve:** Plate the grilled chicken alongside the quinoa tabbouleh.\n\n#### Tips:\n- **Make Ahead:** You can marinate the chicken a day in advance and prepare the tabbouleh a few hours before serving.\n- **Vegetarian Option:** Substitute the chicken with grilled eggplant or zucchini slices.\n\n#### Wine Pairing:\nA medium-bodied white wine like Chardonnay or a light red like Grenache complements the dish well.\n\n---\n\n### Dessert: Olive Oil Cake with Citrus Glaze\n\n#### Ingredients:\n- 1 cup olive oil\n- 1 cup sugar\n- 3 large eggs\n- 1 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (or gluten-free flour blend)\n- 2 teaspoons baking powder\n- Zest of 1 lemon\n- Zest of 1 orange\n- 1/2 cup milk (or almond milk for dairy-free)\n\n**For the Citrus Glaze:**\n- 1 cup powdered sugar\n- 2 tablespoons lemon juice\n- 1 tablespoon orange juice\n\n#### Instructions:\n1. **Preheat Oven:** Preheat your oven to 350\u00b0F (175\u00b0C).
