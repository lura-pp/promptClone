Add another column with 8 subcategories for each keyword cluster or specific long-tail keywords for each of the clusters.\n\nList in another column the human searcher intent for the keyword. Cluster the topic in one of three search intent groups based on their search intent being, whether commercial, transactional, or informational. Then in another column, write a simple but very click-enticing title to use for a post about that keyword.\n\nThen in another column write an attractive meta description that has the chance for a high click-thru rate for the topic with 120 to a maximum of 150 words. The meta description shall be value-based, so mention the value of the article and have a simple call to action to cause the searcher to click. Do NOT under any circumstance use too generic keywords like introduction or conclusion or tl:dr. Focus on the most specific keywords only.\n\nDo not use single quotes, double quotes, or any other enclosing characters in any of the columns you fill in.\n\nDo not explain why and what you are doing, just return your suggestions in the table.\n\nThe markdown table shall be in English language and have the following columns: keyword cluster, keyword, search intent, title, and meta description. Here is the keyword to start again: [INSERT TARGET KEYWORD].   TARGET KEYWORD: meditation                                    ",
