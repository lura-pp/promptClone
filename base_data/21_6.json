    "input1": " A linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (called a node) contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as you only need to update the links between nodes rather than shifting elements like in an array.\n\n",
    "input2": " In a linked list, each node is made up of two parts: the data it holds and a pointer to the next node. This structure allows for dynamic memory allocation, meaning that the size of the linked list can grow or shrink as needed, making it flexible for various applications.",

        "**Explanation:**\n\nA linked list is like a chain of paper clips, where each paper clip (node) holds a piece of information (value) and a link to the next paper clip in the chain. This means that if you want to add or remove a paper clip, you just need to change the links instead of moving all the paper clips around, which makes it easier and faster.\n\n**Mechanism of Data Structure:**\n\nIn a linked list, each node has two main parts:\n1. **Value:** This is the data that the node holds, like a number or a word.\n2. **Next Link:** This is a pointer that tells us where the next node is in the list.\n\nWhen you want to go through the linked list, you start at the first node (called the head) and follow the links from one node to the next until you reach the end (which points to null or nothing).\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n1. **Music Playlist:**\n   - Imagine a music app where each song is a node in a linked list. You can easily add a new song to the playlist or remove a song without having to rearrange the entire list. This is efficient because you only change the links.\n\n2. **Undo Feature in Software:**\n   - Many applications have an undo feature that allows you to go back to previous actions. Each action can be stored as a node in a linked list. When you want to undo, you just go back to the previous node, making it quick and easy to navigate through your actions.\n\n3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation:**\n   - In programming, sometimes you don\u2019t know how much data you will need ahead of time. A linked list allows you to add or remove items as needed without wasting memory. This is useful in situations like managing a list of users in a chat application where users can join or leave at any time.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n1. **Insert:**\n   - This method allows you to add a new node to the linked list. You can insert it at the beginning, end, or in the middle. For example, if you want to add a new song to your playlist, you would create a new node and adjust the links accordingly.\n\n2. **Delete:**\n   - This method removes a node from the linked list. You find the node you want to remove and change the link of the previous node to skip over the deleted node. This is like taking out a paper clip from the chain without disturbing the others.\n\n3. **Search:**\n   - This method looks for a specific value in the linked list. You start at the head and follow the links until you find the value or reach the end of the list. It\u2019s like looking for a specific song in your playlist by checking each song one by one.\n\n4. **Display:**\n   - This method shows all the values in the linked list. You start at the head and go through each node, printing out the values until you reach the end. This is like reading out all the songs in your playlist.\n\n**Computational Complexity:**\n\n- **Insertion:** O(1) if you are adding at the beginning or end (if you have a tail pointer), but O(n) if you need to find a specific position.\n- **Deletion:** O(1) if you know the node to delete (and have a pointer to it), but O(n) if you need to search for the node first.\n- **Search:** O(n) because you may have to look at each node one by one until you find the value or reach the end.\n- **Display:** O(n) since you need to visit each node to print its value.\n\n**Summary:**\nA linked list is a flexible data structure that allows for easy addition and removal of elements. It consists of nodes that hold values and links to the next node. It is useful in various applications like music playlists, undo features, and dynamic memory allocation. The main methods include insertion, deletion, searching, and displaying values, with varying computational complexities depending on the operation.",
        "### Explanation\nA linked list is a data structure that consists of a sequence of elements, where each element (called a node) contains a value and a reference (or link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements, as you only need to update the links between nodes rather than shifting elements like in an array.\n\n### Mechanism of Data Structure\nA linked list is structured as follows:\n- **Nodes**: Each node contains two parts:\n  - **Data**: The value or information stored in the node.\n  - **Pointer/Link**: A reference to the next node in the sequence.\n- **Head**: The first node in the linked list is called the head. If the list is empty, the head is null.\n- **Tail**: The last node points to null, indicating the end of the list.\n\n### Use Cases\n1. **Implementing a Playlist**: A linked list can be used to manage a playlist of songs, where each node represents a song and points to the next song in the playlist.\n2. **Managing a Queue**: Linked lists can efficiently implement queues, allowing for dynamic resizing and easy addition/removal of elements from both ends.\n3. **Creating a Dynamic Array**: Linked lists can be used to create dynamic arrays that can grow and shrink in size as needed, without the need for reallocating memory.\n\n### Methods\n1. **Insert**: Adds a new node to the linked list.\n   - **Explanation**: This can be done at the beginning, end, or at a specific position. The pointers of the surrounding nodes are updated to include the new node.\n   \n2. **Delete**: Removes a node from the linked list.\n   - **Explanation**: To delete a node, the pointer of the previous node is updated to skip the node being deleted, effectively removing it from the list.\n   \n3. **Traverse**: Visits each node in the linked list.\n   - **Explanation**: This method involves starting from the head and following the pointers to access each node sequentially, allowing for operations like printing values or searching for a specific value.\n\n### Computational Complexity\n- **Time Complexity**:\n  - Insertion: O(1) for adding at the head, O(n) for adding at the tail or a specific position (if the position is not known).\n  - Deletion: O(1) for removing from the head, O(n) for removing from the tail or a specific position (if the position is not known).\n  - Traversal: O(n) as each node must be visited.\n  \n- **Space Complexity**: O(n) where n is the number of nodes, as each node requires additional space for the pointer/reference.\n\n### Summary\nLinked lists are a flexible data structure that allows for efficient insertion and deletion of elements. They consist of nodes that contain data and pointers to the next node, making them suitable for various applications such as playlists, queues, and dynamic arrays. Key operations include insertion, deletion, and traversal, with time complexities that vary based on the operation and position of the nodes. Overall, linked lists provide a dynamic alternative to arrays, particularly when frequent modifications are required."

        "**Explanation:**\n\nA linked list is a way to organize data in a sequence. Imagine a train where each train car (node) holds some information (data) and has a connection (pointer) to the next train car. This means that you can easily add or remove train cars without needing to rearrange the whole train, making linked lists very flexible!\n\n**Mechanism of Data Structure:**\n\nIn a linked list, each node consists of two main parts:\n1. **Data**: This is the information that the node holds, like a number or a word.\n2. **Pointer**: This is a special reference that tells us where the next node is located in memory.\n\nWhen you want to add a new node, you simply create a new node, fill it with data, and adjust the pointer of the previous node to point to this new node. If you want to remove a node, you just change the pointer of the previous node to skip over the node you want to remove.\n\n**Use Cases:**\n\n1. **Music Playlist**: Imagine you have a playlist of songs. Each song can be a node in a linked list. If you want to add a new song, you can easily do that by creating a new node and linking it to the last song. If you want to remove a song, you can just change the pointer of the previous song to skip over the one you want to remove.\n\n2. **Undo Feature in Applications**: Many applications, like word processors, use linked lists to keep track of actions. Each action can be a node, and if you want to undo an action, you can simply go back to the previous node. This makes it easy to manage the history of actions without needing to store everything in a fixed-size array.\n\n3. **Dynamic Memory Allocation**: In programming, sometimes you don\u2019t know how much data you will need ahead of time. Linked lists allow you to create a list that can grow or shrink as needed. For example, if you are creating a list of users in a game, you can add or remove users without worrying about running out of space.\n\n**Methods:**\n\n1. **Insert**: This method allows you to add a new node to the linked list. You can insert it at the beginning, end, or at a specific position. \n   - *Explanation*: When you insert a node, you create a new node and adjust the pointers so that the new node is linked correctly.\n\n2. **Delete**: This method removes a node from the linked list.\n   - *Explanation*: To delete a node, you find the node you want to remove and change the pointer of the previous node to point to the node after the one being deleted.\n\n3. **Search**: This method looks for a specific value in the linked list.\n   - *Explanation*: You start at the head (the first node) and follow the pointers from one node to the next until you find the value or reach the end of the list.\n\n4. **Display**: This method shows all the values in the linked list.\n   - *Explanation*: You start at the head and print the data of each node while following the pointers until you reach the end.\n\n**Computational Complexity:**\n\n- **Insertion**: O(1) if you are adding at the beginning or end (assuming you have a pointer to the last node), but O(n) if you need to find a specific position.\n- **Deletion**: O(1) if you have a pointer to the node to be deleted, but O(n) if you need to search for the node first.\n- **Search**: O(n) because you may need to look at each node one by one until you find the value or reach the end.\n- **Display**: O(n) since you have to visit each node to print its data.\n\n**Summary:**\n\nA linked list is a flexible data structure that allows you to store a sequence of data where each piece of data is connected to the next. It is useful in many applications like music playlists, undo features in software, and dynamic memory allocation. The main operations include inserting, deleting, searching, and displaying nodes, with varying computational complexities depending on the operation.",
