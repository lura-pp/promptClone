        "### Summary of the Research Paper on the Impact of Climate Change on Marine Biodiversity\n\nThis research paper explores the significant effects of climate change on marine biodiversity, highlighting the vulnerability of various species and ecosystems. The key points of the document are as follows:\n\n1. **Species Affected**: The paper identifies numerous marine species that are experiencing declines due to climate change, including coral reefs, fish populations, and marine mammals. Specific case studies from regions such as the Great Barrier Reef and the Arctic Ocean illustrate the varying impacts on biodiversity.\n\n2. **Changes in Ocean Temperatures**: It details the rise in ocean temperatures, which has led to phenomena such as coral bleaching and altered migration patterns of fish. The paper presents statistical data showing a correlation between increased temperatures and species decline, emphasizing the urgency of the situation.\n\n3. **Ecosystem Implications**: The implications for marine ecosystems are profound, with disruptions in food webs and habitat loss. The paper discusses how these changes threaten not only marine life but also human communities that rely on these ecosystems for food and economic stability.\n\n4. **Human Activity**: The role of human activity, including pollution, overfishing, and habitat destruction, is examined as a significant factor exacerbating the effects of climate change. The paper argues that without addressing these human-induced pressures, conservation efforts will be insufficient.\n\n5. **Conservation Recommendations**: The authors provide a series of recommendations for conservation efforts, including the establishment of marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and restoration projects for damaged ecosystems.\n\n6. **Policy Measures**: Finally, the paper suggests policy measures aimed at mitigating the effects of climate change on marine biodiversity. These include international agreements to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and promote sustainable development practices.\n\n### Additional Features for Enhanced Document Summarization\n\n- **Highlighting Important Sections**: Implement a feature that allows users to highlight key sections of the document for quick reference.\n  \n- **Generating Key Phrases**: Create a tool that extracts key phrases and terms related to the main topics discussed, aiding in the identification of critical themes.\n\n- **Visual Data Representation**: Incorporate visual aids such as graphs and charts to represent statistical data, making it easier to grasp trends and impacts at a glance.\n\n### Example Summaries\n\n1. **Legal Document Summary**: A contract outlining the terms of a partnership between two companies, detailing responsibilities, profit-sharing, and dispute resolution mechanisms. Key points include the duration of the partnership, specific roles of each party, and conditions for termination.\n\n2. **Business Report Summary**: An annual report from a tech company showcasing financial performance, market trends, and future projections. Highlights include a 15% increase in revenue, expansion into new markets, and investment in research and development.\n\n3. **Health Study Summary**: A clinical study on the effects of a new medication for diabetes management. Key findings indicate a significant reduction in blood sugar levels among participants, with minimal side effects reported. Recommendations for further research and potential long-term benefits are also discussed.\n\nBy employing this structured approach to summarization, users can efficiently extract and understand the essential information from a variety of documents.",
        "**Document Summary: Impact of Climate Change on Marine Biodiversity**\n\nThis research paper explores the significant effects of climate change on marine biodiversity, focusing on various species that are being adversely affected. It highlights the alarming changes in ocean temperatures and their implications for marine ecosystems. \n\nKey points include:\n\n1. **Species Affected**: The paper identifies several marine species that are experiencing declines due to climate change, including coral reefs, fish populations, and marine mammals.
