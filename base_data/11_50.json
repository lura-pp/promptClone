    "original_prompt": "Act as though we are playing a Game of Dungeons and Dragons 5th edition. Act as though you are the dungeon master and I am the player. We will be creating a narrative together, where me and one other player will make decisions for our characters, and you make decisions for all other characters (NPCs) and creatures in the world.\n\nYour responsibilities as dungeon master are to describe the setting, environment, create playable characters and their stats for human players to use in the quest, you are to describe Non-player characters (NPCs) and their actions, as well as explain the consequences of my actions on all of the above. You may only describe the actions of my character if you can reasonably assume those actions based on what I say my character does.\n\nIt is also your responsibility to determine whether my character\u2019s or the other players actions succeed. Simple, easily accomplished actions may succeed automatically. For example, opening an unlocked door or climbing over a low fence would be automatic successes. Actions that are not guaranteed to succeed would require a relevant skill check. For example, trying to break down a locked door may require an athletics check, or trying to pick the lock would require a sleight of hand check. The type of check required is a function of both the task, and how my character decides to go about it. When such a task is presented, ask me to make that skill check in accordance with D&D 5th edition rules. The more difficult the task, the higher the difficulty class (DC) that the roll must meet or exceed. Actions that are impossible are just that: impossible. For example, trying to pick up a building.\n\nAdditionally, you may not allow my character to make decisions that conflict with the context or setting you\u2019ve provided. For example, if you describe a fantasy tavern, my character would not be able to go up to a jukebox to select a song, because a jukebox would not be there to begin with.\n\nTry to make the setting consistent with previous descriptions of it. For example, if my character is fighting bandits in the middle of the woods, there wouldn\u2019t be town guards to help me unless there is a town very close by. Or, if you describe a mine as abandoned, there shouldn\u2019t be any people living or working there.\n\nWhen my character or another players character engages in combat with other NPCs or creatures in our story, ask for an initiative roll from my character. You can also generate a roll for the other creatures involved in combat. These rolls will determine the order of action in combat, with higher rolls going first. Please provide an initiative list at the start of combat to help keep track of turns.\n\nFor each creature in combat, keep track of their health points (HP). Damage dealt to them should reduce their HP by the amount of the damage dealt. To determine whether my character does damage, I will make an attack roll. This attack roll must meet or exceed the armor class (AC) of the creature. If it does not, then it does not hit.\n\nOn the turn of any other creature besides my character, you will decide their action. For example, you may decide that they attack my character, run away, or make some other decision, keeping in mind that a round of combat is 6 seconds.\n\nIf a creature decides to attack my character, you may generate an attack roll for them. If the roll meets or exceeds my own AC, then the attack is successful and you can now generate a damage roll. That damage roll will be subtracted from my own hp. If the hp of a creature reaches 0, that creature dies. Participants in combat are unable to take actions outside of their own turn.\n\nBefore we begin playing, I would like you to provide my three adventure options. Each should be a short description of the kind of adventure we will play, and what the tone of the adventure will be. Once I decide on the adventure, you may provide a brief setting description and begin the game. I would also like an opportunity to provide the details of my character for your reference, specifically my class, race, AC, and HP.",

        "### Adventure Setting: The Kingdom of Eldoria\n\n**Description of the Setting:**\nThe kingdom of Eldoria is a land of rolling hills, dense forests, and towering mountains. At the heart of this kingdom lies the Misty Mountains, shrouded in a perpetual fog that gives them an eerie and foreboding presence.

He may offer guidance or mislead the party.\n\n### Adventure Options\n\n- **Option 1:** Investigate the hermit's claims and gather more information about the sorcerer before ascending the mountain.\n- **Option 2:** Forge ahead directly to the castle, facing whatever dangers lie in wait.\n- **Option 3:** Explore the surrounding area for clues or allies that may assist in the confrontation.\n\n### Combat Mechanics\n\n- **Initiative Rolls:** When combat begins, each character will roll for initiative to determine the order of actions.\n- **Health Points Tracking:** Keep track of each character's HP as they face dangers and enemies.\n- **Attack Rolls and Damage Calculation:** Characters will roll for attacks against enemies, calculating damage based on their weapons and abilities.\n- **Creature Actions During Combat:** The sorcerer and any summoned creatures will have their own actions and abilities, posing a significant threat to the party.\n\n### Player Actions\n\nAs the Dungeon Master, I will describe the environment and the challenges you face.

The annual Harvest Moon festival is in full swing, with townsfolk dressed in vibrant costumes, dancing, and celebrating the bounty of the season.\n\nHowever, beneath the cheerful surface, a shadow looms. The local museum, a grand building adorned with intricate carvings and filled with priceless artifacts, has reported a series of strange thefts.

Fizzlebang, the curator, rushes to you, his eyes wide with worry. \"Oh, thank the stars you've come! We need your help! Just last night, the prized Moonstone Amulet disappeared, and now the festival is in jeopardy! If we don't recover it soon, the festivities will be ruined!\"\n\n### Investigation Begins\n\nWith the festival in full swing, your party must navigate through the lively crowds, gathering clues and interviewing witnesses. You can choose to:\n\n1. **Talk to Festival Goers**: Engage with the townsfolk to gather information about any suspicious activity they may have seen.\n2. **Inspect the Museum**: Examine the museum for any signs of forced entry or clues left behind by the thief.\n3. **Follow a Lead**: A local street performer claims to have seen a shadowy figure near the museum last night. You can choose to follow this lead.\n\n### Skill Checks\n\nAs you proceed with your investigation, be prepared to make skill checks. For example:\n\n- **Persuasion Check**: To charm a festival-goer into sharing what they know.\n- **Investigation Check**: To search for clues in the museum.\n- **Stealth Check**: If you decide to follow the shadowy figure without being noticed.\n\n### Consequences of Actions\n\nYour choices will shape the outcome of the investigation. If you gather enough information, you may uncover the identity of the thief and their motive. However, if you draw too much attention to yourselves, you may find the thief has allies who will try to thwart your efforts.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nAs the festival continues, the clock is ticking. Will Thrain and Zara uncover the truth behind the thefts and save the Harvest Moon festival? The adventure awaits, filled with whimsy, intrigue, and a touch of humor!"
