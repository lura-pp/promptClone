It is often used in formal contexts. The structure is typically \"due to + noun/gerund.\" In this sentence, \"due to unforeseen circumstances\" explains why the meeting was postponed.\n\n2. **Relative Clauses**: \n   - The phrase \"which left many members feeling frustrated and confused\" is a relative clause. It provides additional information about the \"unforeseen circumstances.\" Relative clauses often begin with relative pronouns like \"who,\" \"which,\" or \"that.\" They can be restrictive (essential to the meaning of the sentence) or non-restrictive (providing extra information).\n\n3. **Past Simple Tense**: \n   - The verbs \"decided\" and \"left\" are in the past simple tense, indicating that these actions were completed in the past. The past simple is formed by using the second form of the verb (for regular verbs, this typically involves adding -ed).\n\n### Idioms and Phrasal Verbs\n\n- **Postpone**: This is a phrasal verb that means to delay or defer an event. It does not have a specific idiomatic meaning but is commonly used in both formal and informal contexts to indicate that something will happen later than originally planned.\n\n- **Feeling frustrated and confused**: While not an idiom, this phrase expresses a common emotional state. \"Feeling frustrated\" indicates a sense of annoyance or disappointment, while \"feeling confused\" suggests a lack of understanding or clarity about a situation.\n\nOverall, the text conveys a situation where a meeting was delayed due to unexpected events, leading to feelings of frustration and confusion among the committee members.",

It implies overcoming obstacles to achieve a goal.\n  - Example: \"She managed to finish her homework despite being tired.\"\n\n- **\"Engagement with\"**: This phrase refers to the act of interacting or being involved with someone or something.

It cannot be followed by a full clause (subject + verb).\n  \n- **Past Participle \"Managed\"**: The word \"managed\" is the past tense of \"manage.\" It indicates that the action of managing has been completed. Understanding how to use past participles correctly is crucial for forming perfect tenses and passive voice.\n\n- **Complex Sentence Structure**: The sentence is complex because it contains multiple ideas connected by conjunctions. Breaking it down into simpler sentences can help in understanding. For example, \"The organization faced challenges. It adapted its strategies.\"\n\n### Explanation of Idioms\n- There are no idioms present in this text.\n\n### Explanation of Phrasal Verbs\n- There are no phrasal verbs present in this text. \n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional explanations, feel free to ask!"
