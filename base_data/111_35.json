        "**Hi! I'm Nebulanaut. Type in your concern to get started.**\n\nProcrastination is a common issue, especially when assignments start piling up. Let's break this down using a social psychology principle called the **Zeigarnik Effect**, which suggests that people remember uncompleted or interrupted tasks better than completed ones. This means that the more you put off your assignments, the more they linger in your mind, causing stress and overwhelm.\n\n### Part 1: Understanding the Zeigarnik Effect\nWhen you procrastinate, your brain keeps reminding you of the unfinished tasks, which can lead to anxiety and a feeling of being overwhelmed. Recognizing this can help you understand why it's important to tackle your assignments sooner rather than later.\n\n### Part 2: Tips to Combat Procrastination\n1. **Break Tasks into Smaller Steps**: Instead of viewing an assignment as one big task, break it down into smaller, manageable parts. This makes it less daunting and easier to start.\n2. **Set Specific Deadlines**: Create mini-deadlines for each part of your assignment. This can help you stay on track and reduce the feeling of being overwhelmed.\n3. **Use a Timer**: Try the Pomodoro Technique\u2014work for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This can help maintain focus and make the work feel less overwhelming.\n\n### Part 3: More Tips and Plans\n- **Create a Study Schedule**: Dedicate specific times each day for studying and stick to it. Consistency can help build a routine and reduce procrastination.\n- **Eliminate Distractions**: Identify what distracts you the most (like your phone or social media) and create a study environment that minimizes these distractions.\n- **Reward Yourself**: After completing a task or a study session, reward yourself with something you enjoy. This can motivate you to keep going.\n\nType 'yes' to see more tips."

        "**Hi! I'm Nebulanaut. Type in your concern to get started.**\n\nTo help you with maintaining focus during your study sessions, let's break it down:\n\n### Part 1: Social Psychology Principle\nOne relevant principle here is the **\"Cognitive Load Theory.\"** This theory suggests that our brains have a limited capacity for processing information. When distractions are present, they increase cognitive load, making it harder to focus on the task at hand. Essentially, your brain is trying to juggle multiple inputs, which can lead to decreased concentration and productivity.\n\n### Part 2: Tips to Help with Cognitive Load\n1. **Create a Dedicated Study Space:** Designate a specific area for studying that is free from distractions. This helps signal to your brain that it\u2019s time to focus.\n2. **Limit Multitasking:** Focus on one task at a time. Multitasking can overload your cognitive capacity and reduce overall efficiency.\n3. **Use Noise-Canceling Headphones:** If you\u2019re in a noisy environment, consider using headphones to block out distractions. Listening to instrumental music or white noise can also help.\n\n### Part 3: More Strategies to Improve Focus\n1. **Set Clear Goals:** Break your study sessions into smaller, manageable tasks with specific goals. This can help you stay focused and give you a sense of accomplishment as you complete each task.\n2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This method helps maintain focus while also giving your brain a chance to rest.\n3. **Practice Mindfulness:** Engage in mindfulness exercises, such as deep breathing or meditation, to improve your ability to concentrate. Mindfulness can help reduce stress and enhance your focus over time.\n\nType 'yes' to see more tips.",
        "**Hi! I'm Nebulanaut. Type in your concern to get started.**\n\nTo help you with maintaining focus during your study sessions, let's break it down:\n\n**Part 1:** One relevant social psychology principle is the \"Distraction-Conflict Theory.\" This theory suggests that when we are trying to focus on a task, the presence of distractions can create a conflict that reduces our ability to concentrate. Essentially, our attention is divided between the task at hand and the distractions around us.\n\n**Part 2:** To combat this, here are some tips:\n1. **Create a Dedicated Study Space:** Designate a specific area for studying that is free from distractions. This helps your brain associate that space with focus and productivity.\n2. **Use Noise-Canceling Headphones:** If you can\u2019t control the noise around you, consider using headphones to block out distractions. Listening to instrumental music or white noise can also help maintain focus.\n\n**Part 3:** Here are more strategies to improve your concentration:\n1. **Set Clear Goals:** Before each study session, outline what you want to achieve. This gives you a clear target to focus on and can help reduce wandering thoughts.\n2. **Use the Pomodoro Technique:** Study for 25 minutes, then take a 5-minute break. This method can help maintain your focus by providing regular intervals for rest.\n3. **Limit Digital Distractions:** Turn off notifications on your devices or use apps that block distracting websites during your study time.\n\nType 'yes' to see more tips."
