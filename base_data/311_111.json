    "title": "'''Knowledge Graph'''\n\nA knowledge graph is a structured representation of knowledge that captures relationships between different entities. It is a way to organize information and make it more accessible and understandable for both humans and machines.\n\nIn a knowledge graph, entities are represented as nodes, and the relationships between entities are represented as edges. This allows for a more interconnected and contextual understanding of information.\n\nKnowledge graphs are used in various fields, such as artificial intelligence, data science, and information retrieval. They enable applications like semantic search, question answering systems, and recommendation engines to provide more accurate and relevant results.\n\nBy leveraging the power of knowledge graphs, organizations can enhance their data management and analysis capabilities, leading to improved decision-making and insights.",
