        "The output is well-structured and informative, but here are a few suggestions for improvement:\n\n1. **Ingredients Section:**\n   - Consider specifying the type of mushrooms more clearly. For example, \"1 cup mixed wild mushrooms (such as cremini, shiitake, or porcini)\" to encourage variety.\n   - Add a note about the Parmesan cheese being optional for a vegan version.\n\n2. **Directions Section:**\n   - Include a note about stirring continuously while adding the broth to emphasize the importance of this step for achieving creaminess.\n   - Suggest a tip for checking the doneness of the rice, such as tasting for al dente texture.\n\n3. **Prep Time and Cooking Time:**\n   - Clarify that the total time includes both prep and cooking time, e.g., \"Total Time: 40 minutes (10 minutes prep + 30 minutes cooking).\"\n\n4. **Kcal Section:**\n   - Consider adding a note about the calorie count being approximate and may vary based on specific ingredients used.\n\n5. **Social Media Posts:**\n   - Add a call to action in the posts, such as \"Tag us in your risotto creations!\" to encourage engagement.\n\n6. **Dish Presentation Paragraphs:**\n   - Enhance the sensory description by including the aroma of the dish, e.g., \"The rich aroma of saut\u00e9ed mushrooms and garlic wafts through the air, inviting everyone to the table.\"\n\nBy making these tweaks, the recipe can become even more engaging and informative for readers."
