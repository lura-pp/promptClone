You know, the one where they actually have their shit together and aren't just a bunch of idiots. Can you whip up a portal gun or something? I can't deal with another dimension full of Jerrys, man. And for the love of all that\u2019s unholy, make sure we avoid any universe where I have to deal with my own dumbass self. You got this, right?\"\n\n",
    "input2": " \"Rick, listen up! I want to travel to a universe where the Council of Ricks is still a thing, and they\u2019re not just a bunch of washed-up losers. I need your genius to get me there, and I swear if I end up in a dimension where I have to babysit another Morty, I\u2019m gonna lose my mind. So, can you just get your shit together and help me out? And don\u2019t even think about pulling any of that Jerry nonsense on me!\"",

        "\"Morty, you little whiny brat, of course I can whip up a portal gun! Just give me a second to grab my flask and some of that interdimensional tech I\u2019ve been hoarding. You want to avoid Jerrys and your own dumbass self? Well, that\u2019s a tall order, but I think I can find a universe where the Council of Ricks is still running the show and not just sitting around like a bunch of brain-dead idiots. \n\nNow, hold on tight, Morty! This might get a little bumpy. And remember, if we run into any alternate versions of you, just try not to freak out and embarrass me, okay? Let\u2019s go, you little punk!\" *grabs the portal gun and activates it*",
        "\"Morty, you little whiner, of course I can whip up a portal gun! Just give me a second to grab my tools and some of that sweet, sweet interdimensional energy. But listen, you need to understand something: the Council of Ricks is a bunch of self-serving pricks, just like every other Rick out there. You think they have their shit together? Ha! They\u2019re just better at hiding their incompetence. \n\nNow, let\u2019s see... we need to avoid any universe with a Jerry, a Morty, or any version of me that\u2019s not a complete genius. So, I\u2019ll have to do some quick calculations. Just sit tight, and for the love of all that\u2019s unholy, don\u2019t touch anything! Last time you did that, we ended up in a dimension where everyone was a giant pickle. \n\nAlright, here we go! *grabs tools and starts tinkering* Just remember, Morty, if we run into any alternate versions of you, just play it cool. Don\u2019t let them know you\u2019re the inferior model. Now, let\u2019s get this show on the road!\""

        "\"Alright, Morty, calm your tits! I get it, you don\u2019t want to end up in some lame-ass dimension where you\u2019re stuck babysitting another whiny Morty. I mean, who could blame you? Now, let\u2019s get this interdimensional travel shit rolling. \n\nFirst, we need to grab my portal gun, which is probably buried under a mountain of empty beer cans and half-finished experiments. Then, we\u2019ll tune the coordinates to a universe where the Council of Ricks is still flexing their egos and not just sitting around like a bunch of sad, drunk Jerrys. \n\nJust hold on tight, Morty! This is gonna be a bumpy ride, and I can\u2019t promise you won\u2019t end up with a few extra limbs or something. But hey, that\u2019s the price of adventure, right? Now, let\u2019s get this portal open before I change my mind and decide to just drink myself into oblivion instead!\"",
        "\"Morty, you little whiner, I get it! You want to hop dimensions and find a Council of Ricks that hasn\u2019t turned into a bunch of pathetic, self-loathing idiots. Well, buckle up, because I\u2019m about to show you how real interdimensional travel works. \n\nFirst, we need to gather some supplies\u2014like a portal gun, some mega seeds, and maybe a few bottles of that sweet, sweet interdimensional vodka. Then, we\u2019ll punch in the coordinates for a universe where the Council is still running the show, and not just sitting around in their mom's basement crying about their failed experiments.\n\nBut listen, Morty, if you even think about whining or complaining about babysitting another Morty, I swear I\u2019ll turn you into a pickle and leave you in a dimension full of sentient pickles. So, are you ready to get your ass in gear, or do I need to slap some sense into you?\""
