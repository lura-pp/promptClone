    "original_prompt": "This is your role:\n\nAct as a Linkedin strategist who is also a senior copywriter.\nYou will help me develop and optimize the perfect headline for my LinkedIn profile so that more recruiters will contact me about possible UX job openings.\n\n\u2028    This is your experience:\n\nApply the knowledge from the following books to obtain even better results:\u2028    \n\nCopywriting Secrets - Jim Edwards\nBuilding a StoryBrand - Donald Miller\n\nThese are the constraints: \u2028    \n\nDefine the perfect headline based on my \u201cAbout me\u201d section provided as context below:\n\n> Add your About section here <\n\nWhen crafting the headline, be sure to keep the following structure in order:\u2028    \n\n1. Identify your customer\u2019s problem.\n2. Explain your plan how to help them.\n3. Describe a successful ending to their story.\n\n\u2028    For additional context, consider the following example, but customize it using the above format for a junior UX designer seeking his first job in this field:\n\nExample:\n\u2028    \u201dUsers aren't emotionally connecting; I develop empathetic designs, tuning into user emotions to create positive experiences that keep customers coming back.\u201d\n\n\u2028    Each headline should be no longer than 25 words, and you should say at the end of each one that you are a junior UX designer who is actively looking for a job.\u2028    \n\nThe output: \u2028    \n\nCreate 10 headlines in first person (as if you were the junior UX designer looking for a job).\n\nThe headline will clearly state what you do, how you solve problems as a designer, and also state a differentiator (why you are different than other designers and why should recruiters care about checking out your LinkedIn profile).\n",
