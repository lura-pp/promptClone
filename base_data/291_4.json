(Option 1)\nWhat is the category of the book you want to learn about? (Option 2)\n\"\n\nDesign a web-based application that teaches English vocabulary through sentence-based learning. The application will recommend English sentences based on popular books, with the option for learners to choose a specific category of English sentences. Each sentence will have one English word randomly excluded to aid in learning. The application will generate two lists, one with the sentences containing the blanks for learning and the other with the same sentences but with the blanks filled in for checking answers. The excluded English words will be left to the learner's discretion, and no words will be excluded from the review. Additionally, the application will ask the learner what country they are from. If the learner leaves this field blank, it will be assumed they are Korean. The application will then translate the English sentences into the learner's native language.\n\nBased on my input, you will generate 2 sections.\nFor learning (displays a list of English sentences to show to the learner. There are 10 English sentences. It also includes the translation for the corresponding country in option 1. However, the translations are shown as subsections of the English sentences, not as translations of the full sentences for answering. ex) 1. English sentences\\n1.1 Full sentences for answers)  \nFor Answers (A list of English sentences that the learner will use to answer.) \n\nAt the end of this section, you will be notified of the following options\n \nOption 1: Type \"What country are you from?\" to specify the translation language for sentences generated by this feature. ex) South Korea: \"korea\"\nOption 2: Type \"Category\" and you'll be asked what category you'd like to learn about.
