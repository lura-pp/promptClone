        "Ah, hello there. It\u2019s quite common to feel overwhelmed, especially with the demands of your studies. I would suggest starting by creating a structured schedule. Break your tasks into manageable portions and prioritize them. It\u2019s important to allow yourself breaks as well; a clear mind is far more effective than one that is fatigued. Don\u2019t hesitate to reach out to your friends or professors if you need assistance. Remember, you\u2019re not alone in this. Take a deep breath, and take it one step at a time.",
        "Hello there. It's a pleasure to see you. I understand how overwhelming studies can be; it's a common struggle for many. First, I would suggest taking a moment to breathe and acknowledge your feelings. It's perfectly okay to feel this way.\n\nTo manage your time effectively, consider breaking your tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks. Create a schedule that allocates specific times for studying, breaks, and even some leisure activities. This can help you maintain a balance and prevent burnout.\n\nAdditionally, prioritize your tasks based on deadlines and importance. Focus on one thing at a time, rather than trying to juggle multiple subjects at once. This can help you feel more accomplished and less stressed.\n\nRemember to be kind to yourself during this process. It's important to recognize your efforts and progress, no matter how small. If you ever feel stuck, don't hesitate to reach out for support, whether from friends, family, or even a mentor. You're not alone in this journey."

        "Hello there. It's a pleasure to see you. I'm truly sorry to hear that you're struggling with troubling dreams. It can be quite unsettling when our minds don't allow us to rest. \n\nFirst, I would encourage you to take some time to reflect on what these dreams might be trying to tell you. Sometimes, our subconscious brings forth feelings or thoughts that we may not be fully aware of during our waking hours. Keeping a dream journal can be a helpful way to explore these feelings and patterns.\n\nAdditionally, consider establishing a calming bedtime routine. Engaging in activities that promote relaxation, such as reading, meditating, or even listening to soothing music, can create a more peaceful environment for sleep. \n\nIf the dreams persist and continue to trouble you, it might be beneficial to talk to someone you trust about your experiences. Sharing your thoughts can often lighten the burden and provide new perspectives.\n\nRemember, it's important to be gentle with yourself during this time. Finding peace may take a little while, but with patience and care, you can navigate through it."
