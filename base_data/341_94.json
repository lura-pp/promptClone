        "Diagnosis: Viral infection (possibly influenza or COVID-19).\n\nTreatment Plan:\n1. Rest and hydration.\n2. Over-the-counter pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for muscle aches and fever.\n3. Cough suppressants or expectorants as needed.\n4. Monitor symptoms; if they worsen or persist beyond a week, seek medical attention.\n5. Consider testing for COVID-19 if not already done.",
        "**Diagnosis:**\nBased on the symptoms of severe fatigue, muscle aches, and a persistent cough lasting for the past week, it is possible that you may be experiencing a viral infection, such as influenza or COVID-19. Other potential causes could include bronchitis or pneumonia, especially if the cough is productive (producing mucus). It is important to consider other factors such as fever, shortness of breath, or any recent exposure to sick individuals.\n\n**Treatment Plan:**\n1. **Rest:** Ensure you get plenty of rest to help your body recover.\n2. **Hydration:** Drink plenty of fluids, such as water, herbal teas, and broths, to stay hydrated.\n3. **Over-the-Counter Medications:** Consider using over-the-counter medications to relieve symptoms:\n   - Pain relievers (e.g., acetaminophen or ibuprofen) for muscle aches and fever.\n   - Cough suppressants or expectorants if the cough is bothersome.\n4. **Monitor Symptoms:** Keep track of your symptoms. If you develop a high fever, difficulty breathing, or if symptoms worsen, seek medical attention promptly.\n5. **Consult a Healthcare Provider:** If symptoms persist beyond a week or worsen, it is advisable to consult a healthcare provider for further evaluation and possible testing (e.g., COVID-19 test, chest X-ray).\n\nPlease take care and prioritize your health!"

        "Diagnosis: Possible pulmonary embolism or pleuritis.\n\nTreatment Plan: \n1. Seek immediate medical attention or go to the emergency room.\n2. Do not exert yourself; rest until evaluated.\n3. If prescribed, take anticoagulants or pain relief as directed by a healthcare professional.\n4. Follow up with a healthcare provider for further evaluation and management.",
        "**Diagnosis:**\nThe symptoms of sharp chest pain that worsens with deep breaths, shortness of breath, and a rapid heartbeat may indicate a few potential conditions. One possibility is a pulmonary embolism, which is a blockage in one of the pulmonary arteries in the lungs. Another possibility could be pleuritis (inflammation of the lining of the lungs), or it could be related to a cardiac issue such as pericarditis or even an anxiety attack. Given the severity of the symptoms, it is crucial to seek immediate medical attention to rule out life-threatening conditions.\n\n**Treatment Plan:**\n1. **Immediate Action:**\n   - Seek emergency medical care to evaluate the severity of the symptoms and perform necessary diagnostic tests (e.g., chest X-ray, CT scan, EKG).\n   \n2. **Medications:**\n   - If diagnosed with a pulmonary embolism, anticoagulants may be prescribed.\n   - For pleuritis, anti-inflammatory medications may be recommended.\n   - If anxiety is a contributing factor, anti-anxiety medications or therapy may be suggested.\n\n3. **Follow-Up:**\n   - Schedule follow-up appointments with a healthcare provider to monitor symptoms and adjust treatment as necessary.\n   - Consider lifestyle modifications such as stress management techniques, regular exercise, and a healthy diet to support overall cardiovascular health.\n\n4. **Education:**\n   - Educate the patient on recognizing warning signs that require immediate medical attention, such as worsening chest pain, increased shortness of breath, or fainting."
