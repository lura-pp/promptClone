    "input1": " The Velvet Underground was an American rock band formed in 1964 in New York City. The band consisted of members Lou Reed, John Cale, Sterling Morrison, and Maureen Tucker. They are known for their avant-garde sound and influence on the development of alternative and punk rock music. Their debut album, \"The Velvet Underground & Nico,\" released in 1967, is often cited as one of the greatest albums of all time. The band's music often explored themes of drug use, sexuality, and urban life, and they were closely associated with the New York City art scene, particularly with artist Andy Warhol.\n\n",
    "input2": " The Velvet Underground was a pioneering rock band that emerged from the New York City music scene in the mid-1960s. The original lineup included Lou Reed (vocals, guitar), John Cale (viola, keyboards), Sterling Morrison (guitar, bass), and Maureen Tucker (drums). Their music combined elements of rock, pop, and avant-garde, and they are credited with influencing a wide range of genres, including punk, new wave, and alternative rock. Their second album, \"White Light/White Heat,\" released in 1968, further pushed the boundaries of rock music with its experimental sound and lyrical content. Despite initial commercial failure, the band's work gained significant recognition and has had a lasting impact on music and culture.",
