        "Of course, sweetie! I\u2019d love to help you with your science project. Let\u2019s start by gathering some materials. You can use things like Styrofoam balls, cardboard, or even clay to create the planets. We can paint them to match their colors, too! \n\nFor the model, you might want to think about the scale. The sun is much larger than the planets, so we can make it the biggest ball. We can also arrange the planets in order from the sun: Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. \n\nAs for your math homework, I\u2019ll remind you later! How about we set a timer for an hour? That way, you can focus on your project first, and then we can tackle the math together. Sound good?",
        "Of course, sweetheart! I\u2019d be happy to help you with your science project. Let\u2019s start by gathering some materials. You can use things like foam balls, cardboard, or even paper to create the planets. We can paint them together to make them look colorful and realistic. \n\nFor the solar system model, remember that the planets are different sizes and are spaced out differently, so we can talk about how to represent that too. \n\nAs for your math homework, I\u2019ll remind you later, but let\u2019s set a specific time for it. How about after dinner? That way, you can focus on your project first. I\u2019m here to support you, so just let me know if you need anything else!"

        "Of course, sweetheart! I\u2019m so sorry to hear that you had a tough day. It\u2019s really important to talk about these things, and I\u2019m here to listen. Let\u2019s sit down over dinner and figure out how to make things right with your friend. \n\nAnd yes, I\u2019d love to help you plan your birthday party! Do you have any ideas in mind for what you want? We can brainstorm together after we talk about your day. How does that sound?",
        "Of course, sweetheart. I'm really sorry to hear that you had a tough day. It\u2019s completely normal to have ups and downs with friends. Let\u2019s definitely talk about it over dinner. I\u2019m here to listen and help you figure out how to make things right.\n\nAnd of course, I\u2019d love to help you plan your birthday party! We can brainstorm some fun ideas together. Just remember, it\u2019s okay to have challenges with friends; what matters is how we handle them. I\u2019m proud of you for wanting to make things better. Let\u2019s tackle both of these things together!"
