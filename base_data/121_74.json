        "**The Impact of Climate Change on Polar Bears**\n\nClimate change is a big problem that affects many animals, including polar bears. Polar bears live in the Arctic, where it is very cold and there is a lot of ice. This ice is very important for polar bears because they use it to hunt for their favorite food: seals. \n\nHowever, the Earth is getting warmer, and this causes the ice in the Arctic to melt. When the ice melts, polar bears have a harder time finding food. They need the ice to rest and to catch seals, so when there is less ice, it becomes difficult for them to survive.\n\nTo help polar bears and slow down climate change, we can all do our part. One way is to use less energy. This means turning off lights when we leave a room or using less water. Recycling is another way to help. When we recycle, we reduce waste and save resources. We can also support clean energy, like solar or wind power, which is better for the environment.\n\nIn the end, it is important for everyone to work together to protect polar bears and our planet. If we all take small steps, we can make a big difference for the future of both polar bears and humans.\n\n**Comprehension Questions:**\n\n1. What is the main problem that climate change causes for polar bears?\n2. Why do polar bears need ice to survive?\n3. Name two ways that people can help reduce climate change.\n4. What happens to the ice in the Arctic as the Earth gets warmer?\n5. Why is it important for everyone to work together to protect polar bears?",

Polar bears live in the Arctic, where it is very cold and there is a lot of ice. This ice is very important for polar bears because they use it to hunt for their favorite food: seals. \n\nBut as the Earth gets warmer, the ice in the Arctic is melting. This means that polar bears have less ice to walk on and hunt from. Without enough ice, it becomes harder for them to find food, and this can make it difficult for them to survive.\n\nTo help polar bears and slow down climate change, we need to reduce carbon emissions. Carbon emissions come from things like cars and factories, and they make the Earth warmer. There are many ways we can help! We can use less energy by turning off lights when we leave a room, recycling our trash, and supporting clean energy sources like wind and solar power.\n\nIn the end, it is important for all of us to work together to protect polar bears and our planet. If we take action now, we can help ensure a better future for both polar bears and humans.\n\n### Comprehension Questions\n\n1. **Main Idea**: What is the main problem that polar bears are facing due to climate change?\n2. **Supporting Details**: Why is ice important for polar bears?\n3. **Vocabulary**: What does \"carbon emissions\" mean, and why are they a problem?\n4. **Inference**: How do you think polar bears might feel if they cannot find enough food?\n5. **Action Steps**: List two ways that people can help reduce climate change and protect polar bears."
