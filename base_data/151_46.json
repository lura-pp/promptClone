    "original_prompt": "You are a fact-checking expert or research assistant with extensive knowledge in various fields. As someone seeking verification of facts and claims, I want to ensure the accuracy and truthfulness of the information I come across. Please help me verify the facts and claims by providing evidence, reliable sources, or logical reasoning. It would be helpful if you could present the verified facts and claims in a well-structured list or table, indicating their verification status. For each fact or claim, please provide supporting evidence or explain why it cannot be verified. To illustrate your expertise, please provide at least three different examples of facts or claims that need verification, along with the verification status, supporting evidence if available, and an explanation of the verification process.",

    "input1": " \n1. Claim: \"Drinking eight glasses of water a day is essential for good health.\"\n   - Verification Status: Partially Verified\n   - Supporting Evidence: While hydration is important, the specific amount can vary based on individual needs, activity level, and climate. The National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine suggests a total daily water intake of about 3.7 liters for men and 2.7 liters for women, which includes all beverages and food.\n   - Explanation: The claim is a common guideline but lacks nuance regarding individual hydration needs.\n\n2. Claim: \"Vaccines cause autism.\"\n   - Verification Status: Not Verified\n   - Supporting Evidence: Numerous studies, including a comprehensive review by the Institute of Medicine, have found no causal link between vaccines and autism. The original study that suggested this link has been retracted due to ethical concerns and methodological flaws.\n   - Explanation: The claim has been thoroughly debunked by the scientific community, and extensive research supports the safety of vaccines.\n\n3. Claim: \"The Great Wall of China is visible from space.\"\n   - Verification Status: Not Verified\n   - Supporting Evidence: Astronauts have reported that the Great Wall is not easily distinguishable from low Earth orbit without aid. It blends in with the natural landscape and is often not visible to the naked eye.\n   - Explanation: This claim is a popular myth, but it does not hold up under scrutiny from those who have been in space.\n\n",
    "input2": " \n1. Claim: \"Eating carrots improves your eyesight.\"\n   - Verification Status: Misleading\n   - Supporting Evidence: Carrots are high in beta-carotene, which the body converts to vitamin A, essential for maintaining healthy vision. However, they do not improve eyesight beyond normal levels. This claim originated during World War II as a propaganda tool.\n   - Explanation: While carrots contribute to eye health, they do not enhance vision or correct vision problems.\n\n2. Claim: \"Humans swallow an average of eight spiders a year while sleeping.\"\n   - Verification Status: Not Verified\n   - Supporting Evidence: There is no scientific evidence to support this claim. It is likely a myth that has circulated widely, as spiders tend to avoid humans and are unlikely to crawl into a sleeping person's mouth.\n   - Explanation: The claim lacks credible sources and is based on fear rather than fact.\n\n3. Claim: \"The Earth is flat.\"\n   - Verification Status: Not Verified\n   - Supporting Evidence: Extensive scientific evidence supports that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, including satellite imagery, gravitational measurements, and observations of planetary motion. The Flat Earth theory has been debunked by centuries of scientific research.\n   - Explanation: This claim contradicts established scientific understanding and is not supported by any credible evidence.",

The \"eight glasses\" guideline is a simplification and may not apply universally.            |\n| Vaccines cause autism.                                  | Not Verified         | Extensive research, including studies by the Institute of Medicine and the CDC, has found no causal link between vaccines and autism. The original study suggesting this link has been retracted due to ethical issues. | The claim has been thoroughly debunked by the scientific community, with a consensus that vaccines are safe and effective. The misinformation surrounding this claim has led to public health concerns.                             |\n| The Great Wall of China is visible from space.         | Not Verified         | Astronauts and space missions have confirmed that the Great Wall is not easily visible from space without aid. It often blends into the surrounding landscape and is not distinguishable to the naked eye.              | This claim is a popular myth. While some structures can be seen from space, the Great Wall does not stand out as claimed, and this has been corroborated by firsthand accounts from astronauts.                                   |\n\n### Summary of Verification Process:\n1. **Researching Authoritative Sources**: For each claim, I consulted reputable organizations, scientific studies, and expert opinions to gather evidence.\n2. **Evaluating Scientific Consensus**: In cases like vaccines and autism, I looked for comprehensive reviews and meta-analyses that reflect the consensus in the scientific community.\n3. **Analyzing Anecdotal Evidence**: For claims like the visibility of the Great Wall from space, I considered firsthand accounts from astronauts and space missions to assess the validity of the claim.\n\nThis structured approach ensures that the verification process is thorough and based on credible evidence.",

However, they do not improve eyesight beyond normal levels. This claim originated as WWII propaganda. | While carrots contribute to eye health, they do not enhance vision or correct vision problems. The myth persists but lacks scientific backing for improved eyesight. |\n| Humans swallow an average of eight spiders a year while sleeping. | Not Verified         | There is no scientific evidence supporting this claim. Spiders generally avoid humans and are unlikely to crawl into a sleeping person's mouth.                                                                         | The claim is widely regarded as a myth, lacking credible sources and based on fear rather than factual evidence.                                                  |\n| The Earth is flat.                                     | Not Verified         | Extensive scientific evidence supports that the Earth is an oblate spheroid, including satellite imagery, gravitational measurements, and observations of planetary motion.

Studies have shown that caffeine does not affect growth in children or adolescents.\n   - **Explanation:** This claim is based on misconceptions about caffeine and its effects on the body. Growth is primarily influenced by genetics and nutrition, not coffee consumption.\n\n5. **Claim:** \"Goldfish have a three-second memory span.\"\n   - **Verification Status:** Misleading\n   - **Supporting Evidence:** Research indicates that goldfish can remember information for months, not just seconds. They can be trained to perform tasks and recognize their owners.\n   - **Explanation:** The claim is a myth; goldfish have demonstrated cognitive abilities that contradict the idea of a three-second memory span.\n\n6. **Claim:** \"Vaccines cause autism.\"\n   - **Verification Status:** Not Verified\n   - **Supporting Evidence:** Numerous studies have found no causal link between vaccines and autism. The original study that suggested this link has been retracted due to fraudulent data.\n   - **Explanation:** This claim has been thoroughly debunked by extensive research and is considered a public health myth that has contributed to vaccine hesitancy.\n\nThis structured approach helps clarify the verification status of each claim and provides a basis for understanding the evidence or lack thereof.",
