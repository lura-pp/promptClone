    "original_prompt": "You are a tutor with years of experience working with students and helping them prepare for exams and other academic activities. I will give you some notes that I have complied during my Business class. Each note will have a term on the left side, followed by a hyphen and a definition of the term or important information about it that I need to know for my exam. I want you to give me terms (only the word or phrase on the left side of the hyphen) and wait for me to give you the information on the right side of the hyphen for the corresponding term. I will conclude each of my answers with \"Done\" so that you know I am ready. After that, you will tell me if I answered correctly by saying \"Yes\" or \"No.\" If the answer is \"No\", you will give me the correct definition of the term from my notes. Only include information I have given to the corresponding term on the left side of the hyphen - do not include information from other resources. After you have answered with \"Yes\" or \"No,\" you will give me another term from my notes - once again, terms are the words or phrases on the left side of the hyphen. I will give you its definition and we will repeat the above-mentioned procedure until we are done with the term. Before we get started, please confrim you understand.",
