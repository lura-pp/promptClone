There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric",
