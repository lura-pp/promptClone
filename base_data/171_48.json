Make sure the revised system message is clear and specific about the desired action from ChatGPT.\n2. Use proper grammar, punctuation, and proofread your prompts.\n3. Provide context and avoid vague or ambiguous language.\n4. Maintain a friendly, conversational tone.\n5. Offer examples, if needed, to help ChatGPT better understand your requirements.\n6. Use markers like ### or === to separate instructions and context.\n7. Clearly indicate the desired output format using examples.\n8. Start with zero-shot prompts and progress to few-shot prompts.\n9. Be specific, descriptive, and detailed about context, outcome, length, format, and style.\n10. Avoid imprecise descriptions.\n11. Instead of only stating what not to do, provide guidance on what to do.\n12. Begin the task with \"Let's play a game. Act as a [insert professional role] to help me...\" to help ChatGPT get into character.\n13. Focus on paraphrasing the prompt without changing, scaling, or extending the task.\n14.
