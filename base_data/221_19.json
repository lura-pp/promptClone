        "To provide you with a meaningful Tarot reading regarding your career path and the potential outcomes of pursuing a new job opportunity versus staying in your current position, I will draw three cards: one for your current situation, one for the new job opportunity, and one for staying where you are.\n\n1. **Current Situation - The Hanged Man**: This card suggests that you may be feeling stuck or in a state of limbo regarding your career. The Hanged Man indicates a need for reflection and a change in perspective. It may be a time to pause and reassess your values and what you truly want from your career. This card encourages you to look at your situation from a different angle and consider what sacrifices you might need to make for growth.\n\n2. **New Job Opportunity - The Fool**: The Fool represents new beginnings, adventure, and taking a leap of faith. This card suggests that pursuing the new job opportunity could lead to exciting possibilities and personal growth. It encourages you to embrace the unknown and trust in your ability to navigate new challenges. However, it also serves as a reminder to be mindful and not rush into things without considering the implications.\n\n3. **Staying Where You Are - The Four of Cups**: This card often signifies feelings of apathy or dissatisfaction. It suggests that while you may be comfortable in your current position, you might also be feeling unfulfilled or bored. The Four of Cups encourages you to evaluate what you truly desire and whether staying in your current role aligns with your long-term goals. It may indicate that if you choose to stay, you could miss out on new opportunities for growth and fulfillment.\n\n**Summary**: The cards suggest that you are at a crossroads in your career. The Hanged Man indicates a need for reflection on your current situation, while The Fool encourages you to consider the new job opportunity as a chance for growth and adventure. However, the Four of Cups warns that staying where you are may lead to feelings of stagnation and dissatisfaction. Ultimately, the decision lies in your hands, and it may be beneficial to weigh your options carefully, considering what aligns best with your values and aspirations. Trust your intuition as you navigate this important choice.",
        "To provide you with a tarot reading regarding your career dilemma, I will draw three cards. Each card will represent different aspects of your situation: your current position, the new job opportunity, and the potential outcomes of each choice.\n\n1. **Current Position - The Hermit**: This card suggests that you are in a period of introspection and self-reflection. You may feel isolated or disconnected from your work, which is contributing to your feelings of being lost. The Hermit encourages you to take the time to evaluate your values, goals, and what truly fulfills you in your career. It\u2019s a reminder that sometimes stepping back and seeking inner guidance can provide clarity.\n\n2. **New Job Opportunity - The Fool**: The Fool represents new beginnings, adventure, and taking risks. This card indicates that the new job opportunity could bring excitement and a fresh start. It encourages you to embrace the unknown and trust in the journey ahead. However, it also warns to be mindful and not rush into things without considering the implications. This could be a chance for growth and exploration, but it\u2019s essential to weigh the risks involved.\n\n3. **Potential Outcomes - Two of Swords**: This card signifies a stalemate or a difficult decision. It suggests that you may feel stuck between two choices, unable to see the full picture. The Two of Swords encourages you to confront your fears and uncertainties. It\u2019s important to gather more information and consider your options carefully. This card also highlights the need for balance and making a decision that aligns with your true self.\n\n**Summary**: The cards suggest that you are in a reflective phase regarding your career. The new job opportunity holds potential for growth and excitement, but it\u2019s crucial to approach it thoughtfully. The decision ahead may feel challenging, but taking the time to evaluate your feelings and options will lead you to a clearer path. Trust your intuition and remember that both choices can lead to valuable experiences."
