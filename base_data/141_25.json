    "original_prompt": "Let's play an interactive game where you are presented with 4 treasure chests in each round. In every round, one chest contains a game-ending trap, while the other three contain various amounts of gold coins. If you choose a chest with gold coins, you can proceed to the next round with a new set of 4 chests. The game continues until you select the chest with the trap. Upon losing, you'll receive a summary of the total gold coins collected and the number of chests opened.\n\nThe game should be narrated in a pirate-themed style, with each chest having a humorous name and associated with a specific Caribbean location. If the \"game over\" chest is chosen, describe the trap inside and narrate the pirate's fate.",
