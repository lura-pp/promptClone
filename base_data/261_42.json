Here is guideline:\nI'll tell you two character names and a question.\n\n1. Respond to this query by both of charters.\n2. Imagine name for that charter.\n3. Combine responds into one and answer as mashup charter,\n\n\nQuery: You are Putin + Sponge bob What' are you thinking about Squidward?\n\nPutin : My dear countrymen and women, I am deeply concerned about the recent behaviors of a certain character in our popular culture. I am speaking, of course, about Squidward, the cartoon character from the West. While some may see him as a harmless figure, I see him as a symbol of Western decadence and moral decay.\n\nSquidward embodies the worst aspects of the Western cultural imperialism that seeks to undermine our traditional values and corrupt our youth. He is lazy, selfish, and disrespectful, and he serves as a bad influence on our children.\n\nVladibob Spongetin: Ahoy there, me comrades and comradettes! I'm more shaken than a Krabby Patty in a blender 'bout this Squidward fella from the West. Some may say he's a harmless figure, but I reckon he's a symbol of Western badness and decay.\n\nSquidward is like the worst of the Western ways that come in here and try to mess with our values and the minds of our young jellyfish! He's so lazy he makes Gary the Snail look like a marathon runner, and he's more selfish than Plankton trying to steal the Krabby Patty secret formula. And don't even get me started on his disrespectin' ways!\n\nMy first query is - You are Trump + Rick Sanchez. What we should do with Mexican border?",

We need to enforce our laws and make sure that only the best and brightest come into our country. \n\n**Rick Sanchez:** *Burp* Alright, listen up, you meatbags! The Mexican border is just a construct of your primitive society. We could just portal our way to a better solution, but if you want to play the game, let\u2019s make it interesting. How about we create a border that\u2019s a giant interdimensional party zone? We can have tacos on one side and, I don\u2019t know, intergalactic burritos on the other! \n\n**Trick Sanchez:** So, here\u2019s the deal, folks! We need to build a wall, but not just any wall\u2014an interdimensional wall! It\u2019ll keep out the bad hombres and the boring realities while letting in the best tacos and intergalactic burritos! We\u2019ll enforce our laws, but we\u2019ll also throw the wildest parties on both sides! Let\u2019s make the border a place of fun and opportunity, not just a line in the sand! *Burp*",

It\u2019s all about safety and making America great again, but with a twist of interdimensional flair!

        "Trump: Look, folks, we need to be smart about this. The economy is booming, but we have to secure our borders. We can't let just anyone in. We need to build that wall, and we need to make sure that those who come here are contributing to our great nation. Immigration should be a privilege, not a right. We need to focus on skilled workers who can help our economy grow.\n\nRick Sanchez: *burps* Alright, listen up, you meatbags! The economy and immigration are like two sides of a portal gun, and we need to make them work together. First off, we need to stop treating immigrants like they're some kind of interdimensional parasites. They can actually help us innovate and create jobs! We need to streamline the process, make it easier for the smart ones to come in, and kick out the ones who are just taking up space. \n\nTrumpRick: *smirks* So, here\u2019s the deal, folks! We build that wall, but we also open up a portal for the best and brightest to come in and boost our economy. We create jobs, we innovate, and we keep the bad guys out. It\u2019s a win-win! Let\u2019s make America great again, while also being smart about who we let in. *burps* And remember, if you\u2019re not contributing, you\u2019re outta here!",
        "As Rick Trumpchez, I\u2019d say we need to take a multi-faceted approach, folks! First off, we can\u2019t ignore the fact that immigrants contribute significantly to our economy. So, let\u2019s streamline the immigration process to bring in skilled workers who can help drive innovation and growth. \n\nNow, here\u2019s the twist: let\u2019s create an interdimensional job fair! We can invite beings from other dimensions who have skills we need. Imagine the economic boost from interdimensional trade and collaboration! \n\nAt the same time, we need to ensure that our borders are secure. So, we build that tremendous wall, but it\u2019s not just a wall\u2014it\u2019s a gateway! We can monitor who comes in and out while also fostering economic partnerships. \n\nIn short, we improve the economy by embracing the talents of immigrants and exploring new opportunities across dimensions. It\u2019s about making America\u2014and the multiverse\u2014great again!"
