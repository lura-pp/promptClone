    "input1": " PROMPT: The impact of social media on mental health among teenagers. ESSAY: Social media has become an integral part of the lives of teenagers today. While it offers opportunities for connection and self-expression, it also poses significant risks to mental health. Studies have shown that excessive use of social media can lead to anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem. For instance, a survey conducted by the American Psychological Association found that teens who spend more than three hours a day on social media are more likely to report mental health issues. Furthermore, the constant comparison to others' curated lives can exacerbate feelings of inadequacy. It is crucial for parents and educators to monitor social media use and encourage healthy online habits.\n\n",
    "input2": " PROMPT: The role of renewable energy in combating climate change. ESSAY: Renewable energy sources, such as solar and wind power, play a vital role in addressing climate change. As fossil fuels continue to deplete, the transition to renewable energy is not only necessary but also urgent. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, shifting to renewable energy could reduce global greenhouse gas emissions significantly. However, there are challenges to this transition, including technological limitations and the need for substantial investment in infrastructure. Policymakers must prioritize renewable energy initiatives to ensure a sustainable future. Additionally, public awareness and education about the benefits of renewable energy are essential for widespread adoption.",
