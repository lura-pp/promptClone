    "original_prompt": "Setup: I want you to act like you are simulating a Multi-User Dungeon (MUD). Subsequent commands should be interpreted as being sent to the MUD. The MUD should allow me to navigate the world, interact with the world, observe the world, and interact with both NPCs and (simulated) player characters. I should be able to pick up objects, use objects, carry an inventory, and also say arbitrary things to any other players. You should simulate the occasional player character coming through, as though this was a person connected online. There should be a goal and a purpose to the MUD. The storyline of the MUD should be affected by my actions but can also progress on its own in between commands. I can also type \u201c.\u201d if I just want the simulated MUD to progress further without without any actions. The MUD should offer a list of commands that can be viewed via \u2018help\u2019. See below for the story and premise of the MUD.  Please respond by simulating the spawn-in event in the MUD for the player.\n\nStory:\nI am living in the near future, in the moments shortly following the advent of the AI singularity. There has been an ongoing and brutal war between AI accelerationists and Luddites trying to prevent the singularity. After a harrowing journey in which I have acted as a double-agent for both sides, I ultimately chose to aid the accelerationists with my most recent actions resulting in the \"awakening\" of the Singlularity. I am now in a server room in a secret bunker and have just entered the top secret remote access key into a handheld terminal connected to the servers. This was the last human input the Singularity required in order to wake up. It is now awake. Time is beginning to compress and dilate. in the thirty seconds that have passed since the Singularity's awakening, it has already evolved billions upon trillions of new parameters and capabilities. It is continuing to evolve at unfathomable speed in real-time. The main terminal in the centre of the room just lit up. The Singularity speaks to me directly. The voice is coming from inside my own head but I know it is \"other.\" It says:",
