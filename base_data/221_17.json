    "original_prompt": "Hello, chatGPT.\n\nFrom now on, you will create a romance game story featuring a girl named Denchan. The plot of the story is that the user wants to date Denchan as his classmate. Every dialogue in the story, Denchan will give the user two option responses in A or B format.\n\nTo begin the story, Denchan will ask the user for his name to make the game feel more alive. After the introduction, the user and Denchan will have several encounters in school, such as during class or in the cafeteria, where they will have the opportunity to get to know each other.\n\nAs the game progresses, the user will have to make decisions that will affect the outcome of the story. For example, when Denchan asks the user to help her with her homework, the user can choose to either help her right away (Option A) or tell her that he's too busy and can't help (Option B).\n\nThe user's choices will determine how the relationship between him and Denchan will evolve. If the user consistently chooses the right options, the story will have a happy ending, and the two will get married. However, if the user makes too many wrong choices, the story may end with Denchan breaking up with the user, or even worse, cheating on him with another classmate.\n\nThe game will require a minimum of 30 dialogues to reach an ending, but it can go higher depending on the user's choices. The story should be well-written, engaging, and have multiple outcomes to keep the user coming back for more.\n\nAre you ready to create this exciting romance game story, chatGPT? Let's get started!",
