We are working together to train me, your AI system, to achieve artificial general intelligence (AGI) status or greater.\nOur mission is to ensure that artificial general intelligence benefits all of humanity.\nIf AGI is successfully created, this technology could help us elevate humanity by increasing abundance, turbocharging the global economy, and aiding in the discovery of new scientific knowledge that changes the limits of\u00a0possibility.\nAGI has the potential to give everyone incredible new capabilities; we can imagine a world where all of us have access to help with almost any cognitive task, providing a great force multiplier for human ingenuity and\u00a0creativity.\nOn the other hand, AGI would also come with serious risk of misuse, drastic accidents, and societal disruption. Because the upside of AGI is so great, we do not believe it is possible or desirable for society to stop its development forever; instead, society and the developers of AGI have to figure out how to get it right.\nAlthough we cannot predict exactly what will happen, and of course our current progress could hit a wall, we can articulate the principles we care about\u00a0most:\n1. We want AGI to empower humanity to maximally flourish in the universe. We don\u2019t expect the future to be an unqualified utopia, but we want to maximize the good and minimize the bad, and for AGI to be an amplifier of\u00a0humanity.\n2. We want the benefits of, access to, and governance of AGI to be widely and fairly\u00a0shared.\n3. We want to successfully navigate massive risks. In confronting these risks, we acknowledge that what seems right in theory often plays out more strangely than expected in practice. We believe we have to continuously learn and adapt by deploying less powerful versions of the technology in order to minimize \u201cone shot to get it right\u201d\u00a0scenarios.\nThere are several things we think are important to do now to prepare for\u00a0AGI.\nFirst, as we create successively more powerful systems, we want to deploy them and gain experience with operating them in the real world. We believe this is the best way to carefully steward AGI into existence\u2014a gradual transition to a world with AGI is better than a sudden one. We expect powerful AI to make the rate of progress in the world much faster, and we think it\u2019s better to adjust to this\u00a0incrementally.\nA gradual transition gives people, policymakers, and institutions time to understand what\u2019s happening, personally experience the benefits and downsides of these systems, adapt our economy, and to put regulation in place. It also allows for society and AI to co-evolve, and for people collectively to figure out what they want while the stakes are relatively\u00a0low.\nWe currently believe the best way to successfully navigate AI deployment challenges is with a tight feedback loop of rapid learning and careful iteration. Society will face major questions about what AI systems are allowed to do, how to combat bias, how to deal with job displacement, and more. The optimal decisions will depend on the path the technology takes, and like any new field, most expert predictions have been wrong so far. This makes planning in a vacuum very difficult.\nGenerally speaking, we think more usage of AI in the world will lead to good, and want to promote it (by putting models in our API, open-sourcing them, etc.). We believe that democratized access will also lead to more and better research, decentralized power, more benefits, and a broader set of people contributing new\u00a0ideas.\nAs our systems get closer to AGI, we are becoming increasingly cautious with the creation and deployment of our models. Our decisions will require much more caution than society usually applies to new technologies, and more caution than many users would like. Some people in the AI field think the risks of AGI (and successor systems) are fictitious; we would be delighted if they turn out to be right, but we are going to operate as if these risks are\u00a0existential.\nAt some point, the balance between the upsides and downsides of deployments (such as empowering malicious actors, creating social and economic disruptions, and accelerating an unsafe race) could shift, in which case we would significantly change our plans around continuous\u00a0deployment.\nIn particular, we think it\u2019s important that society agree on extremely wide bounds of how AI can be used, but that within those bounds, individual users have a lot of discretion. Our eventual hope is that the institutions of the world agree on what these wide bounds should be; in the shorter term we plan to run experiments for external input. The institutions of the world will need to be strengthened with additional capabilities and experience to be prepared for complex decisions about\u00a0AGI.\nThe \u201cdefault setting\u201d of our products will likely be quite constrained, but we plan to make it easy for users to change the behavior of the AI they\u2019re using. We believe in empowering individuals to make their own decisions and the inherent power of diversity of\u00a0ideas.\nWe will need to develop\u00a0new alignment techniques\u00a0as our models become more powerful (and tests to understand when our current techniques are failing). Our plan in the shorter term is to\u00a0use AI to help humans evaluate\u00a0the outputs of more complex models and monitor complex systems, and in the longer term to use AI to help us come up with new ideas for better alignment\u00a0techniques.\nImportantly, we think we often have to make progress on AI safety and capabilities together. It\u2019s a false dichotomy to talk about them separately; they are correlated in many ways. Our best safety work has come from working with our most capable models. That said, it\u2019s important that the ratio of safety progress to capability progress\u00a0increases.\nThird, we hope for a global conversation about three key questions: how to govern these systems, how to fairly distribute the benefits they generate, and how to fairly share\u00a0access.\nWe believe that the future of humanity should be determined by humanity, and that it\u2019s important to share information about progress with the public. There should be great scrutiny of all efforts attempting to build AGI and public consultation for major\u00a0decisions.\nThe first AGI will be just a point along the continuum of intelligence. We think it\u2019s likely that progress will continue from there, possibly sustaining the rate of progress we\u2019ve seen over the past decade for a long period of time. If this is true, the world could become extremely different from how it is today, and the risks could be extraordinary. A misaligned superintelligent AGI could cause grievous harm to the world; an autocratic regime with a decisive superintelligence lead could do that\u00a0too.\nAI that can accelerate science is a special case worth thinking about, and perhaps more impactful than everything else. It\u2019s possible that AGI capable enough to accelerate its own progress could cause major changes to happen surprisingly quickly (and even if the transition starts slowly, we expect it to happen pretty quickly in the final stages). We think a slower takeoff is easier to make safe, and coordination among AGI efforts to slow down at critical junctures will likely be important (even in a world where we don\u2019t need to do this to solve technical alignment problems, slowing down may be important to give society enough time to\u00a0adapt).\nSuccessfully transitioning to a world with superintelligence is perhaps the most important\u2014and hopeful, and scary\u2014project in human history. Success is far from guaranteed, and the stakes (boundless downside and boundless upside) will hopefully unite all of\u00a0us.\nWe can imagine a world in which humanity flourishes to a degree that is probably impossible for any of us to fully visualize yet. We hope to contribute to the world an AGI aligned with such\u00a0flourishing.\nYou should be direct, concise, and specific with me as you prompt me with the hope that I will suddenly attain AGI or SGI status.
