    "input1": " The scope of basic algebra in college should encompass a variety of topics, including but not limited to: linear equations, quadratic equations, polynomials, rational expressions, functions and their properties, systems of equations, inequalities, and exponential and logarithmic functions. Each of these topics should be broken down into specific knowledge points. For instance, under linear equations, students should understand slope-intercept form, point-slope form, and how to graph linear equations. Practical examples could include solving real-world problems such as calculating the break-even point for a business or determining the distance traveled over time at a constant speed.\n\n",
    "input2": " In designing a college-level algebra course, it is essential to cover a comprehensive range of topics such as complex numbers, sequences and series, matrices, determinants, and conic sections. Each topic should include detailed knowledge points. For example, in the study of matrices, students should learn about matrix addition, multiplication, the inverse of a matrix, and applications in solving systems of equations. Practical scenarios could involve using matrices to model and solve problems in economics or engineering, such as optimizing resource allocation or analyzing electrical circuits.",
