It is made with simple ingredients, yet it delivers a rich and creamy flavor. The dish is traditionally prepared with guanciale (cured pork cheek), eggs, Pecorino Romano cheese, and black pepper, creating a luscious sauce that clings to the spaghetti.

Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and cook the spaghetti according to package instructions until al dente.  \n2. While the pasta is cooking, cut the guanciale into small pieces and cook in a pan over medium heat until crispy.  \n3. In a bowl, whisk together the eggs, grated Pecorino Romano cheese, and a generous amount of black pepper.  \n4. Once the pasta is cooked, reserve some pasta water and drain the rest.  \n5. Add the hot spaghetti to the pan with the guanciale, removing it from the heat.  \n6. Quickly pour the egg mixture over the pasta, tossing to combine. Add reserved pasta water as needed to achieve a creamy consistency.  \n7. Serve immediately, garnished with extra Pecorino Romano and black pepper.  \n\nLet me know if you have another dish in mind or if you'd like to provide a list of ingredients!",
