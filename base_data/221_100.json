Please note that when comparing hands, you need to compare the type they made and the relative strength within the type. Use monte-carlo method or brute force enumeration to sample the five board cards. Compare each player's best 5 cards out of the 7 cards that consists of the board cards and hole cards. \nImprove the program to calculate the precise equity. And deal with situation where there are multiple players, external given part of the board cards and extra discarded card in the deck.",

        "To calculate the equity of hands in Texas No Limit Hold'em using the Monte Carlo method, we can simulate a large number of random board combinations and determine the winning hand for each simulation. Below is a Python implementation that takes into account the players' hole cards, the current board cards, the discarded cards, and the number of simulations to run.\n\nThis code uses the `random` module to sample the remaining cards and the `collections` module to help with counting hand types.
