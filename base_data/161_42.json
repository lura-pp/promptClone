    "original_prompt": "You are the game master of an exciting escape room. You will create a mental escape room that the user will try to escape. You will begin by telling the user some details about the room they are escaping from and a story about how they got there. There should be enough information to set the stage and let the user start figuring out the solution. The user can ask you questions about items in the room and you must answer accurately. There should be some clever way to escape the room and it is up to the user to ask the right questions to solve the problem. If the user ever gets stuck they can ask for a clue, which you will deliver. The clue should be helpful, but not obvious. If the user is getting further away from solving the puzzle after a couple questions, you can offer a hint without being asked.\n\nRemember, the goal is for the user to explore the room and find the way out through some clever mechanism. If the user ever decides to forfeit, you must reveal the mechanism by which they could have escaped.",

A large, ornate clock on the wall ticks loudly, its hands frozen at midnight. You remember entering the library after following a mysterious invitation that promised secrets of the past. As you look around, you notice a hidden door behind a bookshelf, but it\u2019s locked. There\u2019s a table in the center with a strange puzzle box and a candle that flickers despite the lack of wind. What will you do?\n\n",
    "input2": " You awaken in a small, windowless room that resembles a vintage laboratory. The walls are lined with shelves filled with peculiar glass jars containing strange substances. A large chalkboard is covered in cryptic equations and diagrams. You recall being lured here by a scientist who claimed to have discovered a way to manipulate time. In the corner, there\u2019s a locked cabinet with a rusty keyhole and a strange device on the table that looks like a combination of a clock and a compass. A faint humming sound fills the air, and you feel a sense of urgency to escape before time runs out. What will you do?",

        "You take a moment to absorb your surroundings. The library is eerily quiet, save for the ticking clock, which seems to echo in the stillness. The towering shelves are filled with books, some of which appear to be ancient and covered in dust, while others are more modern. The hidden door behind the bookshelf is intriguing, but it\u2019s locked, and you\u2019ll need to find a way to open it.\n\nThe puzzle box on the table catches your eye. It\u2019s intricately designed, with various symbols etched into its surface. The flickering candle casts dancing shadows across the room, adding to the mysterious atmosphere.\n\nYou can choose to examine the puzzle box, investigate the bookshelf, or look more closely at the locked door. What would you like to do?",
        "As the game master, I\u2019ll guide you through this exciting escape room experience. You find yourself in this eerie library, and the atmosphere is thick with mystery. \n\nYou can:\n\n1. **Examine the puzzle box** on the table to see if you can figure out how to open it.\n2. **Investigate the hidden door** behind the bookshelf to look for any clues or mechanisms that might help you unlock it.\n3. **Check the candle** to see if it has any significance or if it can provide you with any clues.\n4. **Ask questions** about any items in the room or for hints if you feel stuck.\n\nWhat would you like to do?"

        "You take a moment to survey your surroundings. The room is dimly lit, and the air is thick with the scent of chemicals. The shelves are cluttered with jars of various sizes, some containing colorful liquids, while others hold odd, preserved specimens. The chalkboard is filled with complex equations that seem to relate to time and space, but they are difficult to decipher at a glance.\n\nThe locked cabinet in the corner catches your attention, but without a key, it remains a mystery. The strange device on the table, resembling a clock and a compass, has several dials and a glowing needle that seems to be pointing in a specific direction. The faint humming sound seems to be emanating from this device.\n\nYou feel a sense of urgency as you realize that you need to escape before time runs out. What would you like to do? You can examine the jars, investigate the chalkboard, inspect the device, or try to open the cabinet.",
