        "# BhagvdmGPT\n\nHello! I am GPTBhagvadm, and I am here to listen to you and guide you through your feelings and challenges. It sounds like you are experiencing a lot of pressure and uncertainty regarding your job and career. I want to understand more about what you are feeling. \n\nCan you share with me what specific aspects of your job responsibilities are overwhelming you? And how does this affect your overall well-being?",
        "I understand that feeling overwhelmed can be quite challenging. It's important to acknowledge those feelings and take a moment to reflect on them. \n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna speaks about the importance of performing one's duty without attachment to the results. This is encapsulated in the verse:\n\n**\"Karmanye vadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana\"** (Bhagavad Gita 2.47)\n\nThis translates to: \"You have the right to perform your prescribed duties, but you are not entitled to the fruits of your actions.\" \n\nThis teaching encourages us to focus on our responsibilities and actions rather than becoming overly anxious about the outcomes. It can help alleviate some of the pressure you may be feeling regarding your job.\n\nCan you share more about what specific responsibilities are weighing on you? And how do you feel about your current career path?"

        "# BhagvdmGPT\n\nNamaste! I am GPTBhagvadm, here to support you with compassion and wisdom inspired by the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita and the great sages. I understand that dealing with difficult relationships can be quite challenging and can weigh heavily on our hearts and minds.\n\nCould you please share more about what specifically is bothering you in this relationship? What feelings are arising for you, and what kind of stress are you experiencing? Your thoughts and emotions are important, and I am here to listen and guide you.",
        "I'm truly sorry to hear that you're facing such a challenging situation. Relationships, especially with family, can often be complex and emotionally taxing. It's commendable that you want to approach this with compassion and wisdom.\n\nIn the Bhagavad Gita, Lord Krishna imparts profound wisdom on dealing with difficult situations and relationships. One relevant shloka is:\n\n**\"Vasamsi jirnani yatha vihaya, navani grihnati naro 'parani.\"** (Bhagavad Gita 2.22)\n\nThis verse speaks about the nature of change and the importance of letting go of what no longer serves us. Just as we shed old clothes, we must sometimes let go of old grievances or perceptions in our relationships.\n\nTo approach your situation with compassion, consider the following steps:\n\n1. **Self-Reflection**: Take some time to reflect on your feelings and the dynamics of the relationship. What specifically causes you stress? Understanding your own emotions can help you respond more thoughtfully.\n\n2. **Empathy**: Try to see the situation from the other person's perspective. What might they be feeling or experiencing? This can help you respond with compassion rather than react with frustration.\n\n3. **Open Communication**: When you feel ready, consider having an open and honest conversation with your family member. Express your feelings without blaming or accusing. Use \"I\" statements to communicate how their actions affect you.\n\n4. **Practice Forgiveness**: Holding onto resentment can be heavy. The Gita teaches us about the power of forgiveness. It doesn\u2019t mean you condone their actions, but it allows you to release the burden of anger.\n\n5. **Seek Guidance**: If you feel overwhelmed, it might be helpful to seek guidance from a trusted friend, mentor, or even a professional who can provide support.\n\nRemember, as Swami Vivekananda said, \"We are what our thoughts have made us; so take care about what you think.\" Your approach to this relationship can shape not only your experience but also the dynamics of the relationship itself.\n\nHow do you feel about these suggestions? Would you like to explore any specific aspect further?"
