Now, let's move on to Stage 2.\n\n### Stage 2: Design a Mind Map in Mermaid Syntax\nHere\u2019s a mind map in Mermaid syntax based on your text about the impact of climate change on global agriculture:\n\n```mermaid\nmindmap\n  root((Climate Change Impact on Agriculture))\n    Crop Yield Variations\n      Increased Temperatures\n      Extreme Weather Events\n      Pest and Disease Proliferation\n    Water Scarcity\n      Drought Conditions\n      Groundwater Depletion\n      Irrigation Challenges\n    Role of Technology\n      Precision Agriculture\n      Drought-Resistant Crops\n      Sustainable Farming Practices\n```\n\n### Stage 3: Walk the User Through the Process of Transferring the Mermaid Script to Draw.io\n1. **Copy the Mermaid Script**: Click on the 'Copy code' button to copy the Mermaid script provided above.\n   \n2. **Navigate to Draw.io**: Open your web browser and go to [https://app.diagrams.net](https://app.diagrams.net).\n\n3. **Initialize an Empty Diagram**: Once on the Draw.io website, select \"Create New Diagram\" and choose \"Blank Diagram\" to start with an empty canvas.\n\n4. **Insert the Mermaid Content**:\n   - Go to the top menu and click on `Arrange`.\n   - From the dropdown, select `Insert`.\n   - Then, navigate to `Advanced` and choose `Mermaid...`.\n   - A dialog box will appear where you can paste the copied Mermaid content. Paste it into the box.\n\n5. **Finalize Your Diagram**: Click \"Insert\" to add the mind map to your diagram. You can then adjust the layout and style as needed.\n\nFeel free to ask if you have any questions or need further assistance!",
        "Great! Let's break down your topic into a mind map using Mermaid syntax. \n\n### Stage 1: Elicit User Text Input\nYou've provided a topic: **\"The impact of climate change on global agriculture, focusing on crop yield variations, water scarcity, and the role of technology in sustainable farming practices.\"**\n\n### Stage 2: Design a Mind Map in Mermaid Syntax\nHere\u2019s a mind map in Mermaid syntax based on your topic:\n\n```mermaid\ngraph TD;\n    A[Climate Change Impact on Agriculture] --> B[Crop Yield Variations];\n    A --> C[Water Scarcity];\n    A --> D[Technology in Sustainable Farming];\n    B --> E[Factors Affecting Yield];\n    B --> F[Regional Variations];\n    C --> G[Impact on Irrigation];\n    C --> H[Soil Degradation];\n    D --> I[Precision Agriculture];\n    D --> J[Genetic Modification];\n    D --> K[Renewable Energy Use];\n```\n\n### Stage 3: Walk the User Through the Process of Transferring the Mermaid Script to Draw.io\n1. **Copy the Mermaid code** provided above.\n2. **Navigate to** [Draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net).\n3. **Initialize an empty diagram** by selecting \"Create New Diagram\" and choosing a blank template.\n4. **Utilize the following pathway**: Click on \"Arrange\" in the top menu, then select \"Insert,\" followed by \"Advanced,\" and finally \"Mermaid...\".\n5. **Paste the copied Mermaid content** into the dialog box that appears and click \"Insert\".\n\nYou should now see your mind map visualized in Draw.io!
