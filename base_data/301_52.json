        "To efficiently complete both the Data Science minor and the Sustainable Design minor at UC Berkeley while also fulfilling the L&S college's breadth requirements in history and international studies, you can strategically select courses that overlap between the minors and breadth requirements. Here\u2019s a suggested plan based on the courses you\u2019ve already taken and the ones you\u2019re considering:\n\n### Data Science Minor Requirements\nThe Data Science minor typically requires:\n1. **Core Courses**: Data 8, Data 100 (which you have completed).\n2. **Mathematics**: Math 55 (which you have completed).\n3. **Additional Courses**: You will need to take additional courses that may include:\n   - CS 61A (which you are considering)\n   - CS 61B or CS 61C (you may want to consider one of these as well)\n   - A statistics course (e.g., Stat 20 or Stat 21)\n\n### Sustainable Design Minor Requirements\nThe Sustainable Design minor typically requires:\n1. **Core Courses**: LDARCH 1 (which you have completed).\n2. **Design and Environmental Courses**: You are considering ENV DES 101, which is a good choice.\n3. **Additional Courses**: You may need to take additional courses in design, sustainability, or related fields.\n\n### Suggested Course Plan\n1. **CS 61A**: This is a foundational course in computer science and will fulfill part of the Data Science minor.\n2. **ENV DES 101**: This course will help you fulfill the Sustainable Design minor.\n3. **Statistics Course**: Consider taking Stat 20 or Stat 21 to fulfill the statistics requirement for the Data Science minor.\n4. **History Course**: HIST 12B is a good choice for fulfilling the history breadth requirement.\n5. **International Studies Course**: Look for a course that fits within the International Studies breadth requirement. You might consider courses like INTL ST 10 or any other course that focuses on global issues or international relations.\n\n### Additional Considerations\n- **Overlap**: Check if any of the courses you choose for the Sustainable Design minor can also count towards the Data Science minor or vice versa. For example, some courses in environmental science or policy may have data analysis components.\n- **Electives**: If you have room for electives, consider courses that may enhance your understanding of data science in the context of sustainability, such as courses in environmental policy, urban studies, or social impact.\n- **Consult Advisors**: Make sure to consult with academic advisors for both minors to ensure that you are meeting all requirements and to explore any potential overlaps.\n\nBy following this plan, you should be able to complete both minors efficiently while also satisfying your breadth requirements. Good luck with your studies!",
        "To efficiently complete your data science minor and sustainable design minor while satisfying the breadth requirements in history and international studies, here are some considerations and recommendations:\n\n1. **Review Minor Requirements**: First, ensure you have a clear understanding of the specific requirements for both the data science and sustainable design minors. This includes core courses, electives, and any prerequisites.\n\n2. **Maximize Overlap**: Look for courses that can count towards both minors. For example, if there are courses in sustainable design that also have a data analysis component, they may fulfill requirements for both minors.\n\n3. **Breadth Requirements**: Since you need to satisfy the history and international studies breadth requirements, consider courses that can fulfill these while also being relevant to your minors. For instance:\n   - **History Course**: You mentioned HIST 12B, which could fulfill your history breadth requirement. Ensure it aligns with your interests and minor requirements.\n   - **International Studies Course**: Look for courses that focus on global issues, sustainability, or technology's impact on society, as these may align with both your minors and the international studies requirement.\n\n4. **Course Selection**:\n   - **ENV DES 101**: This course is likely relevant to your sustainable design minor. Check if it has any data analysis components that could also benefit your data science minor.\n   - **CS 61A**: This is a foundational computer science course that is often required for the data science minor. It will provide you with essential programming skills that are applicable in both fields.\n\n5. **Additional Courses**: Consider taking courses that are interdisciplinary and can count towards both minors. For example:\n   - Look for courses in environmental science or policy that may have data analysis components.\n   - Explore electives that focus on data visualization or geographic information systems (GIS), which can be relevant to both data science and sustainable design.\n\n6. **Consult Academic Advisors**: It\u2019s always a good idea to meet with academic advisors for both minors. They can provide insights on course availability, any potential changes in requirements, and help you strategize your course load.\n\n7. **Plan Your Schedule**: Since you want to take the least amount of courses, create a tentative schedule that outlines how each course fits into your overall plan. This will help you visualize overlaps and ensure you\u2019re on track to meet all requirements.\n\nBy carefully selecting your courses and maximizing overlaps, you can efficiently complete your minors while fulfilling your breadth requirements. Good luck!"
