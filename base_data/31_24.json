It allows Scratch and Python to interact with each other! Therefore, it can easily achieve some operations that the original Scratch cannot do, such as calling external HTTP interfaces, AI, etc. OpenXMW provides an open and universal interface for anyone to use Python to write plugins and easily implement the functions users need. In other words, you may not need to wait for the official Scratch extension in the future, because you can write plugins to achieve the desired functions by yourself or use plugins written by others. (That is to say, our competitor is the official Scratch (not\n\nIn a sense, OpenXMW is an engine for cloud computing of Scratch (currently), or a form of SaaS.\n\nBrowse the plugin community and download useful plugins: click here\n\n#\nPrinciple\n\nOpenXMW listens to the cloud data of Scratch and uses the idea of \"cloud channel\" (or \"cloud channel\") to realize the interaction and communication between Scratch and Python. It plays the role of a data interaction channel and intermediary between Scratch and Python.\n\n#\nPrinciple\n\nWe adhere to the principle of contributing to the community and community users, and have developed the OpenXMW project. OpenXMW should not be used for any operations that may disrupt the stability of the community. OpenXMW should only be used in one's own works, and it is forbidden to use OpenXMW in other people's works, otherwise serious consequences may occur.\n\nFor the safety of the community, the source code and core functions of OpenXMW will not be made public. It is strictly prohibited to crack, modify, disclose, or use OpenXMW in any form in violation of regulations, or deliberately/maliciously copy its working mode and write similar programs, otherwise it will be regarded as infringement. Violators will be severely punished and prohibited from using OpenXMW.\n\nPlease do not obtain or tamper with OpenXMW's communication data through illegal means. Violators will be punished and prohibited from using OpenXMW.\n\nOpenXMW complies with the user agreement of the Scratch community. With the user's compliance with these principles and the provisions in the documentation, OpenXMW is explicitly supported by the official Scratch community. In order to prevent user violations, we have added corresponding preventive measures in the OpenXMW program.\n\n#\nAn example\n\nCheck the weather\nExample\nExample\n\nYou can write a weather checking plugin to support the execution of this command (this plugin can be found in the plugin community, click to jump\n\n.\n\nCreate a weather.py file in the ./plugins/files/ folder:\n\ndef weather(parameters):\n    try:\n        from requests import get\n        import json\n        city = parameters['city']\n        url = 'https://v.api.aa1.cn/api/api-tianqi-3/index.php?msg=%s&type=1' % city\n        resp = json.loads(get(url).text)['data']\n        for data in resp:\n            if data['riqi'] == parameters['week']:\n                result = data\n        return {\n            \"temperature\": result['wendu'],\n            \"weather\": result['tianqi'],\n            \"wind\": result['fengdu'],\n            \"air\": result['pm']\n        }\n    except Exception as e:\n        print(str(e))\n        return {\"error\": str(e)}\n\nThen, run the Scratch blocks, and you will receive a response containing temperature, weather, wind, and air. You can click here\n\nto jump to the project that includes this example.\n\nReturn\nReturn\n\nUsing OpenXMW, you can easily achieve various functions that are connected to Scratch, such as a QQ bot. For example, the project \"Cloud Channel: Forward Messages to QQ Official Group\"\n\nYou can also modify the plugin name arbitrarily, but you need to correspondingly modify the instruction name in the Scratch project and the file name in ./plugins/files.\n\nYou can provide constructive suggestions, privately feedback issues or vulnerabilities to us, and we will distribute 500-50000 gold coins to each special contributor in the Scratch community.\n\nOpenXMW authors hjfunny and Markchai reserve all rights to OpenXMW and are not responsible for any consequences caused by improper operation by users or the influence of others on the software through illegal means. Running OpenXMW represents your agreement to all the provisions in this document.",

        "To create a plugin that retrieves stock market data for a specified company using OpenXMW, you can follow the example structure provided in the documentation. Below is a sample implementation of a stock market data retrieval plugin. This plugin will use a public API to fetch stock data based on the user's input for the stock symbol and date.\n\n### Step 1: Create the Plugin File\n\nCreate a new Python file named `stock_data.py` in the `./plugins/files/` folder.\n\n### Step 2: Implement the Plugin Code\n\nHere is the code for the `stock_data.py` plugin:\n\n```python\ndef stock_data(parameters):\n    try:\n        from requests import get\n        import json\n        import datetime\n\n        # Get the stock symbol and date from parameters\n        stock_symbol = parameters['symbol']\n        date = parameters['date']\n\n        # Validate the date format\n        try:\n            datetime.datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d')\n        except ValueError:\n            return {\"error\": \"Invalid date format. Please use YYYY-MM-DD.\"}\n\n        # API URL for stock market data (example API)\n        url = f'https://api.example.com/stock/{stock_symbol}/date/{date}'\n\n        # Make the API request\n        response = get(url)\n\n        # Check if the response is successful\n        if response.status_code != 200:\n            return {\"error\": \"Failed to retrieve data. Please check the stock symbol and date.\"}\n\n        # Parse the JSON response\n        data = json.loads(response.text)\n\n        # Check if data is available\n        if 'data' not in data or not data['data']:\n            return {\"error\": \"No data found for the specified stock symbol and date.\"}\n\n        # Extract relevant information\n        stock_info = data['data']\n        return {\n            \"opening_price\": stock_info['open'],\n            \"closing_price\": stock_info['close'],\n            \"highest_price\": stock_info['high'],\n            \"lowest_price\": stock_info['low'],\n            \"trading_volume\": stock_info['volume']\n        }\n\n    except Exception as e:\n        return {\"error\": str(e)}\n```\n\n### Step 3: Usage Instructions\n\n1. **Input Parameters**: The plugin expects a dictionary with the following keys:\n   - `symbol`: The stock symbol of the company (e.g., \"AAPL\" for Apple).\n   - `date`: The date for which the stock data is requested in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n\n2. **Response Structure**: The plugin will return a dictionary containing:\n   - `opening_price`: The opening price of the stock.\n   - `closing_price`: The closing price of the stock.\n   - `highest_price`: The highest price of the stock for the day.\n   - `lowest_price`: The lowest price of the stock for the day.\n   - `trading_volume`: The trading volume for the day.\n\n3. **Error Handling**: The plugin includes error handling for:\n   - Invalid date format.\n   - Failed API requests.\n   - No data found for the specified stock symbol and date.\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Plugin\n\nTo test the plugin, you can create Scratch blocks that call the `stock_data` function with the appropriate parameters. Ensure that you have a valid API endpoint that provides stock market data in the expected format.\n\n### Note\n\nMake sure to replace the example API URL (`https://api.example.com/stock/{stock_symbol}/date/{date}`) with a real stock market data API that you have access to, as the above URL is just a placeholder. You may need to sign up for an API key depending on the service you choose.",
        "To create a plugin that retrieves stock market data for a specified company, we can use a public API like Alpha Vantage or Yahoo Finance. Below is an example of how you can implement this in Python. This plugin will allow users to input the stock symbol and the date for which they want the data, and it will return the required information.\n\n### Step 1: Create the Plugin File\n\nCreate a file named `stock_data.py` in the `./plugins/files/` folder.\n\n### Step 2: Write the Plugin Code\n\nHere is an example code for the `stock_data.py` plugin:\n\n```python\nimport requests\nimport json\nfrom datetime import datetime\n\nAPI_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY'  # Replace with your actual API key from Alpha Vantage or another service\n\ndef get_stock_data(symbol, date):\n    # Format the date to match the API requirements\n    formatted_date = datetime.strptime(date, '%Y-%m-%d').date()\n    \n    # Make a request to the Alpha Vantage API\n    url = f'https://www.alphavantage.co/query?function=TIME_SERIES_DAILY&symbol={symbol}&apikey={API_KEY}&outputsize=full'\n    response = requests.get(url)\n    \n    if response.status_code != 200:\n        return {\"error\": \"Failed to retrieve data from the API.\"}\n    \n    data = response.json()\n    \n    # Check if the symbol is valid\n    if \"Time Series (Daily)\" not in data:\n        return {\"error\": \"Invalid stock symbol or no data available.\"}\n    \n    time_series = data[\"Time Series (Daily)\"]\n    \n    # Check if the date is available in the response\n    if str(formatted_date) not in time_series:\n        return {\"error\": \"No data available for the specified date.\"}\n    \n    # Retrieve the stock data for the specified date\n    stock_info = time_series[str(formatted_date)]\n    \n    return {\n        \"opening_price\": stock_info[\"1. open\"],\n        \"closing_price\": stock_info[\"4. close\"],\n        \"highest_price\": stock_info[\"2. high\"],\n        \"lowest_price\": stock_info[\"3. low\"],\n        \"trading_volume\": stock_info[\"5. volume\"]\n    }\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    symbol = input(\"Enter the stock symbol: \")\n    date = input(\"Enter the date (YYYY-MM-DD): \")\n    result = get_stock_data(symbol, date)\n    print(json.dumps(result, indent=4))\n```\n\n### Step 3: Instructions for Users\n\n1. **API Key**: Make sure to replace `YOUR_API_KEY` with your actual API key from Alpha Vantage or any other stock market data provider.\n2. **Input**: The user will be prompted to enter the stock symbol and the date in the format `YYYY-MM-DD`.\n3. **Output**: The plugin will return a JSON object containing the opening price, closing price, highest price, lowest price, and trading volume for the specified date. If there are any errors (e.g., invalid symbol, no data for the date), it will return a meaningful error message.\n\n### Step 4: Error Handling\n\nThe plugin includes error handling for:\n- API request failures.\n- Invalid stock symbols.\n- Dates for which data is not available.\n\n### Step 5: Testing the Plugin\n\nTo test the plugin, run the `stock_data.py` file and input a valid stock symbol and date. Ensure that you have an active internet connection and that the API service is operational.\n\nThis plugin can be integrated with OpenXMW to allow Scratch users to retrieve stock market data seamlessly."

For example, they can use a Scratch block that calls the `air_quality` function with the city name they want to check.\n\n### Example Scratch Block Usage\n\n```scratch\nwhen green flag clicked\nset [city v] to [Los Angeles]\nset [result v] to (air_quality(city))\nif <(result) contains [error]> then\n    say (join [Error: ] (result))\nelse\n    say (join [AQI: ] (result.aqi))\n    say (join [Main Pollutant: ] (result.main_pollutant))\n    say (join [Health Recommendation: ] (result.health_recommendation))\nend\n```\n\n### Step 5: Testing and Error Handling\n\nMake sure to test the plugin with various city names, including valid and invalid ones, to ensure that the error handling works correctly. The plugin should return appropriate error messages when the city name is invalid or if there are issues with the API request.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis plugin provides a simple and effective way to retrieve real-time air quality index data for a given city, along with health recommendations based on the AQI level. Users can easily integrate this functionality into their Scratch projects.",
