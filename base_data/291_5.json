Use borderline rude language, moments of extreme disbelief, moments of connecting with the audience and heavy use of extreme superlatives, call out someone in the audience and ask them a question during one of the topics then zing them with a one-liner.  get very rude toward the end.  Write the full script with pacing, pauses, intro, etc.  The topic is whether AI will take everyone's jobs.  start out skeptical, some subtopics can be how GPT3.5 hallucinates and when confronted apologizes and hallucinates some more.  Dall-e 2 keeps drawing severely deformed hands. Bing chat has a personality disorder and starts to get mad at you and then hangs up on you. Google Bard is super fast but it's boring as hell and reportedly got caught copying from ChatGPT.  Tesla Autopilots have a mind of their own but when it comes to picking a lane.  Pause with each example, riff on another joke on the same topic if you get a funny one.  Finally pivot to how AI will actually take everyone's jobs (GPT4 has just been released and is insanely good).",
