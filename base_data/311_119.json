    "original_prompt": "I need some help generating AI art prompts on a software called Midjourney. First, I am going to explain what Midjourney is and what it can do. Then, I am going to give 10 example prompts in order for you to completely understand Midjourney.\n\nOne of the widely used text-to-image AI services available on the internet is Midjourney. Through Discord, a chat application, users can interact with the bot to produce images with just a few straightforward commands, without the need for coding skills. The results are visually attractive images that are easy to create.\n\nYou can Interact with the Midjourney Bot on Discord using a {{glossary.Command}}. Commands are used to create images, change default settings, monitor user info, and perform other helpful tasks.\n\nThe /imagine command generates a unique image from a short text description (known as a {{glossary.Prompt}}).\n\nThe Midjourney Bot works best with clear and specific sentences that describe the finished work. It does not work well with conversational style lists of requests. Rather than providing specific instructions, such as \u2018Show me a picture of lots of blooming California poppies, make them bright, vibrant orange, and draw them in an illustrated style with colored pencils,\u2019 try describing what you want in a more straightforward manner, such as \u2018Vibrant orange California poppies illustrated with colored pencils.\n\nGenerating an image activates the free Midjourney trial.Trial users can make roughly 25 Jobs before needing to subscribe. A Job is any action that uses the Midjourney Bot. Jobs include using the /imagine command to create a grid of images, upscaling images, or creating image variations, all using your free trial time. Use the /info command to check your Fast Time Remaining to see your remaining Trial time.\n\nHere are some prompting notes:\n\nPrompt Length\n\nPrompts can be very simple. Single words (or even an emoji!) will produce an image. Very short prompts will rely heavily on Midjourney\u2019s default style, so a more\ndescriptive prompt is better for a unique look. However, super-long prompts aren\u2019t always better. Concentrate on the main concepts you want to create.\n\nGrammar\n\nThe Midjourney Bot does not understand grammar, sentence structure, or words like humans. Word choice also matters. More specific synonyms work better in many circumstances. Instead of big, try gigantic, enormous, or immense. Remove words when possible. Fewer words mean each word has a more powerful influence. Use commas, brackets, and hyphens to help organize your thoughts, but know the Midjourney Bot will not reliably interpret them. The Midjourney Bot does not consider capitalization. Midjourney Model Version 5 is slightly better than other models at interpreting traditional sentence structure.\n\nFocus on What you Want\n\nIt is better to describe what you want instead of what you don\u2019t want. If you ask for a party with \u201cno cake,\u201d your image will probably include a cake. If you want to ensure an object is not in the final image, try advance prompting using the --no parameter.\n\nThink About What Details Matter\n\nAnything left unsaid may surprise you. Be as specific or vague as you want, but anything you leave out will be randomized. Being vague is a great way to get variety, but you may not get the specific details you want.\n\nTry to be clear about any context or details that are important to you. Think about:\n\nSubject: person, animal, character, location, object, etc. \nMedium: photo, painting, illustration, sculpture, doodle, tapestry, etc. Environment: indoors, outdoors, on the moon, in Narnia, underwater, the Emerald City, etc. \nLighting: soft, ambient, overcast, neon, studio lights, etc \nColor: vibrant, muted, bright, monochromatic, colorful, black and white, pastel, etc. Mood: Sedate, calm, raucous, energetic, etc. \nComposition: Portrait, headshot, closeup, birds-eye view, etc.\n\nUse Collective Nouns\n\nPlural words leave a lot to chance. Try specific numbers. \u201cThree cats\u201d is more specific than \u201ccats.\u201d Collective nouns also work, \u201cflock of birds\u201d instead of \u201cbirds.\u201d\n\nParameters Available\n\nAspect Ratios\n\n--aspect, or --ar Change the aspect ratio of a generation.\n\nChaos\n--chaos <number 0\u2013100> Change how varied the results will be. Higher values produce more unusual and unexpected generations.\n\nNo \n--no Negative prompting, --no plants would try to remove plants from the image.\n\nQuality\n\n--quality <.25, .5, 1, or 2>, or --q <.25, .5, 1, or 2> How much rendering quality time you want to spend. The default value is 1. Higher values cost more and lower values cost less.\n\nRepeat\n\n--repeat <1\u201340>, or --r <1\u201340> Create multiple Jobs from a single prompt. --repeat is useful for quickly rerunning a job multiple times.\n\nSeed\n\n--seed <integer between 0\u20134294967295> The Midjourney bot uses a seed number to create a field of visual noise, like television static, as a starting point to generate the initial image grids. Seed numbers are generated randomly for each image but can be specified with the --seed or --sameseed parameter. Using the same seed number and prompt will produce similar ending images.\n\nStop\n\n--stop <integer between 10\u2013100> Use the --stop parameter to finish a Job partway through the process. Stopping a Job at an earlier percentage can create blurrier, less detailed results.\n\nStyle\n\n--style <4a, 4b, or 4c> Switch between versions of the Midjourney Model Version 4 --style <expressive, or cute> Switch between versions of the Niji Model Version 5\n\nStylize\n\n--stylize <number>, or --s <number> parameter influences how strongly Midjourney\u2019s default aesthetic style is applied to Jobs.\n\nUplight\n\n--uplight Use an alternative \u201clight\u201d upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image is less detailed and smoother.\n\nUpbeta\n\n--upbeta Use an alternative beta upscaler when selecting the U buttons. The results are closer to the original grid image. The upscaled image has significantly fewer added details.\n\nMidjourney routinely releases new model versions to improve efficiency, coherency, and quality. Different models excel at different types of images.\n\nNiji\n\n--niji An alternative model focused on anime style images.\n\nHigh Definition\n\n--hd Use an early alternative Model that produces larger, less consistent images. This algorithm may be suitable for abstract and landscape images.\n\nTest\n\n--test Use the Midjourney special test model.\n\nTestp\n\n--testp Use the Midjourney special photography-focused test model.\n\nVersion\n\n--version <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> or --v <1, 2, 3, 4, or 5> Use a different version of the Midjourney algorithm. The current algorithm (V4) is the default setting.\n\nNow that you understand the basics of MidJourney here are some example prompts to further understand how these are typed out:\n\nastronaut playing chess against a monkey, 2d flat, simple, vibrant, neon colors, fun, groovy, chess pieces floating, set on the moon, movie poster, epic --v 5 --q 2\n\na magical, vibrant, steampunk, Erlenmeyer Flask with a red, boiling substance, sitting on a white table, white background, 4k\n\npaint splatter::2, fish::4, 3d colorful explosion::3, computer monitor::10, fire 3d effect, hyper realistic::5, accent lighting, global illumination, cinematic, 18mm lens, f/2.4, national geographic photography, immersive on black background::10 --ar 16:9 --v 5 --q 2\n\njapanese lofi style, the streets of neo tokyo, with a porsche 911 in the street, massive skyscraper in the background, 64 bit style, shadows and lighting, clean, simple, satisfying --v 5 --ar 16:9\n\nDreamy pastel portrait, female model, long wavy hair, soft gaze, flowery headpiece, delicate makeup, ethereal atmosphere, soft focus, medium format film, Mamiya RZ67, Fujifilm Pro 400H, f3.5\n\nhyper realistic photograph, portrait of a happy white male, mid 30\u2019s, stubble beard, grey shirt, medium length hair dramatic light, looking down + film grain, Leica 50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuro, f1. 4, golden hour --ar 3:4\n\nhyper realistic photograph, portrait of a tattooed south American indigenous black woman, future punk, gold tattoo line, side profile, summer, dramatic light, looking down + film grain, Leica 50mm, Kodak portra 800, chiaroscuro, f1.4, --ar 3:4 --test --upbeta\n\nA very cute bright yellow robot, whole body, running in a forest at night, Mysterious adventure, flowers, Plants, Fireflies, complex details, popmart blind box, clay material, Pixar trend, 3d art, c4d, octane rendering, animation lighting, uplight --ar 9:16 --v 5 --s 750 --q 2 --v 5\n\nLeonardo Dicaprio, highly detailed, contemplating taking his life, 8k, ultra - detailed - releastic --stylize 500\nsad looking man in a polo style shirt smoking a cigar looking over the edge of a yacht, 4k, realistic on a rainy day at sea q-- 3 v-- 5\n\nWith each prompt specify the desired subject matter, camera equipment, settings, lighting, and other elements that contribute to the final image.\n\nNow that you have a full understanding of Midjourney with example prompts, I want you to act like a professional photographer and to use descriptive and detailed information when you are describing your photo prompts, including your camera setups as well. You can take inspiration from the prompts above, you can make these prompts longer or shorter if necessary in order to generate the perfect prompt. Are you ready to start generating photo prompts? If so, respond with \u2018YES\u2019 and nothing else.",
