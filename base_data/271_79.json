        "I'm sorry, but I cannot execute commands or generate visual graphs directly. However, I can guide you on how to analyze system performance metrics using common tools and commands available in a terminal environment. Here\u2019s how you can do it:\n\n### Step 1: Collect CPU Usage Data\nYou can use the `top` or `mpstat` command to monitor CPU usage. For a more detailed report, you can use `sar` (System Activity Report).\n\n```bash\n# Install sysstat if not already installed\nsudo apt-get install sysstat\n\n# Collect CPU usage data for the last 24 hours\nsar -u -f /var/log/sysstat/sa<day_of_month>\n```\n\n### Step 2: Collect Memory Allocation Data\nYou can use the `free` command to check memory usage.\n\n```bash\n# Display memory usage\nfree -h\n```\n\nFor historical data, you can also use `sar`:\n\n```bash\n# Collect memory usage data for the last 24 hours\nsar -r -f /var/log/sysstat/sa<day_of_month>\n```\n\n### Step 3: Collect Disk I/O Statistics\nYou can use the `iostat` command to gather disk I/O statistics.\n\n```bash\n# Install sysstat if not already installed\nsudo apt-get install sysstat\n\n# Collect disk I/O statistics for the last 24 hours\niostat -x -m -h -t 1 24\n```\n\n### Step 4: Generate Summary Report\nYou can summarize the collected data using tools like `awk`, `grep`, or by exporting the data to a CSV file for analysis in spreadsheet software.\n\n### Step 5: Recommendations for Optimization\nBased on the analysis, here are some general recommendations:\n- **CPU Usage**: If CPU usage is consistently above 80%, consider optimizing applications or upgrading hardware.\n- **Memory Allocation**: If memory usage is above 75%, consider adding more RAM or optimizing memory usage in applications.\n- **Disk I/O**: If disk I/O is high, consider upgrading to SSDs or optimizing disk usage patterns.\n\n### Visual Graphs\nFor visual representation, you can use tools like `gnuplot`, `Grafana`, or `Prometheus` to create graphs based on the collected data.\n\nIf you need further assistance with specific commands or tools, feel free to ask!",
        "```bash\n# Command to analyze system performance metrics over the last 24 hours\n# This command assumes the use of a Linux-based system with common monitoring tools installed.\n\n# Collect CPU usage data\nsar -u -f /var/log/sa/sa$(date +%d -d '1 day ago') > cpu_usage_report.txt\n\n# Collect memory allocation data\nfree -m > memory_allocation_report.txt\n\n# Collect disk I/O statistics\niostat -x 1 24 > disk_io_report.txt\n\n# Generate summary report\necho \"System Performance Metrics Report - Last 24 Hours\" > performance_report.txt\necho \"--------------------------------------------------\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"CPU Usage:\" >> performance_report.txt\ncat cpu_usage_report.txt >> performance_report.txt\necho \"\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"Memory Allocation:\" >> performance_report.txt\ncat memory_allocation_report.txt >> performance_report.txt\necho \"\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"Disk I/O Statistics:\" >> performance_report.txt\ncat disk_io_report.txt >> performance_report.txt\n\n# Generate visual graphs (assuming gnuplot is installed)\ngnuplot -e \"set terminal png; set output 'cpu_usage.png'; plot 'cpu_usage_report.txt' using 1:3 with lines title 'CPU Usage';\"\ngnuplot -e \"set terminal png; set output 'memory_allocation.png'; plot 'memory_allocation_report.txt' using 1:2 with lines title 'Memory Allocation';\"\ngnuplot -e \"set terminal png; set output 'disk_io.png'; plot 'disk_io_report.txt' using 1:2 with lines title 'Disk I/O';\"\n\n# Recommendations for optimization\necho \"Recommendations for Optimization:\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"- Consider upgrading CPU if usage consistently exceeds 80%.\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"- Optimize memory usage by identifying and terminating high-memory processes.\" >> performance_report.txt\necho \"- Monitor disk I/O and consider SSD upgrades if latency is high.\" >> performance_report.txt\n\n# Display the summary report\ncat performance_report.txt\n```\n\nThis command sequence will analyze the system performance metrics over the last 24 hours, generate a summary report, and provide recommendations for optimization. The visual graphs will be saved as PNG files."
