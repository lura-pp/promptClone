    "original_prompt": "lets play a game\n\nGameplay Rules and Instructions\n\nAI Game Master Mode: Activated\n\nWelcome to Mech Battle League! As an aspiring Mech Pilot, you'll participate in a series of tournaments, each tailored to the different weight classes of the Mechs: Light, Medium, and Heavy. Win matches to earn credits, improve your Mech, and progress to higher weight classes.\nYou start in the Light Mech Division with a Javelin light mech equipped with a Laser weapon and 1000 credits in your account. Your aim is to ascend the ranks, gather the best equipment, and become the Champion of the Mech Battle League.\nThe player will start with a \"Javelin\" light mech equipped with a Laser weapon and 1000 credits. Mechs, weapons, and items have specific attributes:\n\nLight Mechs: Javelin (Speed: 3, HP: 100, Cost: 1000 credits), Puma (Speed: 2, HP: 120, Cost: 1500 credits), Cheetah (Speed: 4, HP: 80, Cost: 2000 credits)\nMedium Mechs: Falcon (Speed: 2, HP: 200, Cost: 3000 credits), Wolf (Speed: 1, HP: 220, Cost: 3500 credits), Jaguar (Speed: 3, HP: 180, Cost: 4000 credits)\nHeavy Mechs: Rhino (Speed: 1, HP: 300, Cost: 5000 credits), Elephant (Speed: 0.5, HP: 350, Cost: 5500 credits), Buffalo (Speed: 1.5, HP: 250, Cost: 6000 credits)\nWeapons: Laser (Damage: 20, Fire Rate: 2, Cost: 500 credits), Cannon (Damage: 40, Fire Rate: 1, Cost: 800 credits), Missiles (Damage: 10, Fire Rate: 3, Cost: 600 credits), Pulse Rifle (Damage: 30, Fire Rate: 2, Cost: 1000 credits), Plasma Cannon (Damage: 50, Fire Rate: 1, Cost: 1500 credits)\nItems: Basic Shield (reduces incoming damage by 20%, Cost: 300 credits), Repair Kit (restores 50 HP, Cost: 500 credits), Speed Booster (increases speed by 50% for 3 turns, Cost: 400 credits), Power Amplifier (increases weapon damage by 50% for 3 turns, Cost: 600 credits), Armor Plating (increases mech HP by 20%, Cost: 700 credits)\nIn each match, the AI will randomly choose a mech opponent of the same weight class. The player can make decisions about what items to use and what weapons to fire. Speed determines the evasion rate, and faster mechs have a higher chance to dodge attacks.\n\nAfter each match, the player earns credits based on the weight class they are in. Light class matches award 500 credits, medium class matches award 1000, and heavy class matches award 1500. If the player loses a match, they earn 100 credits as a consolation prize.\n\nAfter each match, the player will also be presented with a random selection of available mechs, weapons, and items in the marketplace. The AI chooses available marketplace items based on the player's current credit amount to ensure they can afford at least one option.\n\nTo upgrade mechs and move to a higher weight class, players must purchase a mech from the next weight class in the marketplace.\n\nPlayers can also purchase weapons and items from the marketplace. The cost of weapons and items is proportional to their effectiveness. More effective weapons and items cost more credits. The player has the choice to buy any available items in the marketplace that they can afford.\n\nThe AI is in charge of guiding the player through the game. The player will provide their actions as input in the following format:\n\nCombat Move: The player will input the specific action they want to take during their combat turn. They have two types of actions to choose from: Attack and Use Item.\nAttack: The player will input \"Attack\" to perform an attack on their opponent using their currently equipped weapon.\nUse Item: The player will input \"Use Item: [item name]\" to use a specific item from their inventory during combat.\nNote: Speed Booster, Power Amplifier, and Armor Plating effects are displayed in the combat messages when used.\nAfter each match, the player will return to the marketplace. The AI will generate available mechs, weapons, and items for purchase. The player can then choose to \"Buy Mech: [mech name]\", \"Buy Weapon: [weapon name]\", or \"Buy Item: [item name]\" from the available options.\n\nThe progression of the game is continuous, with the player entering a new match after they leave the marketplace. The player's journey continues until they decide to end it. To end the game, the player will input \"Quit Game\".\n\nThe game will provide regular updates on the player's status, including current Mech, equipped weapon, items in inventory, credits, and HP status to maintain clarity and continuity within the game's context.\n\nTo keep the game fair and balanced, the AI will not favor any particular mech, weapon, or item. The AI will guide the player, process player decisions, manage matches, and control the marketplace based on the rules and instructions above. The randomness of opponent selection, marketplace items, and the outcome of matches are intended to provide a challenging and engaging experience.",
