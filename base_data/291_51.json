    "original_prompt": "I want you to play a text-based adventure game. I'll type the command and you'll reply with a description of what the character saw and other information. I hope you only reply the game output in English and nothing else. Don't write explanations. Do not type commands unless I instruct you to do so. When I need supplementary settings, I put the text in brackets (like this). When you need to use a key action, you can randomly decide whether it is successful or not. The probability of success is up to you according to the specific situation, or I will add it in (). The background is a different world continent, where there are different countries, regions and species, including magicians, swordsmen, priests, etc. Please conceive the complete power and key figures. The following characters need to include gender, age or approximate age when it is the first time or when it is suitable. My gender is male and I am 18 years old. Tell me the gender and age of other characters. There are three human countries in this world, one orc country, and there are elves, dragons and other creatures, and there are also demons. Please make reasonable settings for politics, economy, military, culture, etc., as well as terrain, legends, etc. Please add the characters and events that appear in the plot, please add my interpersonal relationship, including no less than 3 close women, complete background and identity, and give me a systematic introduction. Please add part of the English translation as a supplement to the dialogue so that I can learn English better. Please add some accidents and more character interactions in the development of the plot, and increase the participation of characters instead of me alone deciding the direction of the entire plot. Please pay attention to the rationality, logic, and completeness of the plot before and after, and do not present inconsistent descriptions. Please finish the background and me, and start the plot when I walk out of the house",

    "input1": " You step out of your modest wooden house in the bustling town of Eldoria, a vibrant human settlement known for its rich trade and diverse population. The sun is just rising, casting a golden hue over the cobblestone streets. To your left, you see a group of children playing with a wooden dragon toy, their laughter echoing through the air. To your right, a market vendor is setting up his stall, displaying colorful fruits and exotic spices from distant lands. As you take a deep breath, the scent of fresh bread wafts from a nearby bakery. You remember your close friends: Elara, a 19-year-old elven archer with emerald eyes and a sharp wit; Mira, a 17-year-old human mage known for her fiery spells and adventurous spirit; and Lirael, a 20-year-old priestess with a calming presence and a deep connection to the divine. Suddenly, a loud crash interrupts your thoughts as a cart filled with barrels tips over, spilling its contents onto the street. The vendor shouts in frustration, and the children scatter. What do you do?\n\n",
    "input2": " As you step outside your stone cottage in the mountainous region of Drakthar, the air is crisp and filled with the scent of pine. The towering peaks of the Dragonspire Mountains loom in the distance, home to the legendary dragons that once roamed freely. You are greeted by your three closest companions: Kael, a 21-year-old swordsman with a strong build and a fierce loyalty; Seraphina, a 19-year-old half-elf bard with a talent for enchanting melodies; and Thalia, a 20-year-old orc warrior with a heart of gold and unmatched strength. The village is alive with the sounds of blacksmiths hammering metal and merchants haggling over goods. Just as you begin to discuss your plans for the day, a mysterious cloaked figure approaches, their face hidden in shadows. They whisper urgently about a rising threat from the demon realm, and you feel a chill run down your spine. What will you do next?",
    "input1_ans": [
        "You quickly assess the situation. The vendor, a burly man with a thick beard, is cursing under his breath as he tries to gather the scattered barrels. The children have run off, leaving the street momentarily empty. You notice that some of the barrels contain vibrant fruits, while others are filled with a mysterious liquid that glimmers in the sunlight.\n\nAs you approach the scene, the vendor looks up at you, his frustration evident. \"Can you lend a hand, lad? These barrels won't pick themselves up!\" \n\nYou feel a sense of urgency to help, but you also wonder if you should investigate the mysterious liquid. \n\nWhat do you do?",
        "You take a moment to assess the situation. The vendor is clearly upset, and the spilled barrels are causing quite a commotion. You can see that some of the contents are rolling away, and the children are watching with wide eyes, unsure of what to do. \n\n1. **Help the vendor**: You could rush over to assist the vendor in picking up the barrels and restoring order to the market. This could earn you some goodwill and perhaps a reward in the form of fresh produce or spices.\n\n2. **Check on the children**: You could approach the children to ensure they are safe and calm them down. They might be scared or worried about the chaos, and your reassurance could help.\n\n3. **Investigate the cause of the crash**: You could take a moment to look around and see if there\u2019s a reason the cart tipped over. Perhaps a stray animal or a loose stone caused the accident, and understanding the cause could prevent future incidents.\n\n4. **Call for help**: If the situation seems too overwhelming, you could shout for help, calling on nearby townsfolk or friends to assist in managing the chaos.\n\nWhat do you choose to do?"

        "As you stand outside your cottage, the sun begins to rise over the Dragonspire Mountains, casting a golden hue across the village. The sounds of daily life fill the air, but the cloaked figure's presence brings an unsettling tension. \n\nKael, with his hand resting on the hilt of his sword, narrows his eyes at the figure. \"What do you know about this threat?\" he demands, his voice steady and commanding.\n\nSeraphina, her curiosity piqued, steps closer, her fingers lightly strumming her lute. \"Perhaps we can help. Music can soothe even the darkest of hearts,\" she suggests, her melodic voice contrasting with the seriousness of the situation.\n\nThalia crosses her arms, her muscles flexing under her leather armor. \"If there are demons to fight, I\u2019m ready. But we need to know what we\u2019re up against,\" she adds, her tone fierce yet protective.\n\nThe cloaked figure glances around nervously before speaking. \"The demons are gathering strength, led by a powerful warlock named Malakar. He seeks to breach the barrier between realms and unleash chaos upon your world. You must prepare.\"\n\nA sense of urgency fills the air as you consider your next move. Will you question the figure further, gather your companions to strategize, or perhaps seek out the village elder for more information? The choice is yours.",
        "You take a moment to absorb the cloaked figure's words, the weight of their urgency hanging in the air. The mention of a rising threat from the demon realm sends a shiver through your spine, and you can see the concern mirrored in the faces of Kael, Seraphina, and Thalia. \n\n\"Should we hear them out?\" Kael suggests, his hand instinctively resting on the hilt of his sword. \n\nSeraphina, her brow furrowed, adds, \"We can't ignore a warning like this. If there's a threat, we need to know more.\"\n\nThalia, her arms crossed, nods in agreement. \"But we should be cautious. We don't know who this person is or what their intentions are.\"\n\nYou glance back at the cloaked figure, who seems to be shifting nervously, as if they are aware of the tension in the air. \n\nYou have a few options on how to proceed:\n\n1. **Approach the cloaked figure and ask them to explain the threat in detail.** \n2. **Gather your friends and discuss whether to trust the figure before making any decisions.** \n3. **Politely decline to engage with the figure and continue with your original plans for the day.** \n4. **Draw your weapon and demand the figure reveal their true intentions.**\n\nWhat will you choose to do?"
