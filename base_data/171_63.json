        "To design a `HanoiGame` class for the Towers of Hanoi puzzle, we will create a structured approach that encapsulates the game logic, manages the state of the game, and provides an interface for interaction. The design will include three main classes: `HanoiGame`, `Tower`, and `Disk`. Below is a breakdown of the structure, interactions, and justifications for using classes.\n\n### Class Structure\n\n1. **Disk Class**\n   - **Attributes**: \n     - `size`: An integer representing the size of the disk.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - Constructor to initialize the disk size.\n     - Getter method for size.\n\n2. **Tower Class**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `disks`: A list (or stack) of `Disk` objects representing the disks on the tower.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `push(disk)`: Method to add a disk to the tower.\n     - `pop()`: Method to remove the top disk from the tower.\n     - `peek()`: Method to view the top disk without removing it.\n     - `is_empty()`: Method to check if the tower is empty.\n     - `display()`: Method to display the current state of the tower.\n\n3. **HanoiGame Class**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `towers`: A list of three `Tower` objects.\n     - `move_stack`: A stack to keep track of moves for the undo feature.\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `initialize_game(num_disks)`: Method to set up the game with a specified number of disks on the first tower.\n     - `display_state()`: Method to display the current state of all towers.\n     - `move_disk(source, target)`: Method to move a disk from one tower to another.\n     - `solve(num_disks, source, target, auxiliary)`: Recursive method to solve the puzzle.\n     - `undo()`: Method to undo the last move.\n\n### Justification for Class Design\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: \n   - Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior, which helps manage the complexity of the game logic. For example, the `Tower` class handles the operations related to disks, while the `HanoiGame` class manages the overall game state and rules. This separation of concerns makes the code easier to maintain and understand.\n\n2. **Interactions Between Classes**:\n   - The `HanoiGame` class interacts with `Tower` and `Disk` classes to perform operations. For instance, when moving a disk, `HanoiGame` will call methods on the `Tower` class to push or pop disks. This clear interaction model allows for straightforward implementation of game rules and logic.\n\n3. **Constructors and Destructors**:\n   - Each class will have a constructor to initialize its attributes. For example, the `Disk` constructor initializes the size, and the `Tower` constructor initializes an empty list of disks. Destructors are not strictly necessary in Python due to garbage collection, but if needed, they can be implemented to clean up resources.\n\n4. **Getter/Setter Methods**:\n   - Getter methods (e.g., `get_size()` in `Disk`) provide access to private attributes, while setter methods can be used if we need to modify attributes after initialization. This promotes data encapsulation and protects the integrity of the data.\n\n5. **Temporary Value Storage**:\n   - The use of local variables within methods (e.g., for tracking the source and target towers during a move) helps keep the code clean and avoids unnecessary complexity.\n\n### Example Implementation\n\nHere is a simplified version of the classes:\n\n```python\nclass Disk:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        self.size = size\n\n    def get_size(self):\n        return self.size\n\n\nclass Tower:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.disks = []\n\n    def push(self, disk):\n        if not self.is_empty() and self.peek().get_size() < disk.get_size():\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot place larger disk on smaller disk\")\n        self.disks.append(disk)\n\n    def pop(self):\n        return self.disks.pop() if not self.is_empty() else None\n\n    def peek(self):\n        return self.disks[-1] if not self.is_empty() else None\n\n    def is_empty(self):\n        return len(self.disks) == 0\n\n    def display(self):\n        return [disk.get_size() for disk in reversed(self.disks)]\n\n\nclass HanoiGame:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.towers = [Tower(), Tower(), Tower()]\n        self.move_stack = []\n\n    def initialize_game(self, num_disks):\n        for size in range(num_disks, 0, -1):\n            self.towers[0].push(Disk(size))\n\n    def display_state(self):\n        for i, tower in enumerate(self.towers):\n            print(f\"Tower {i}: {tower.display()}\")\n\n    def move_disk(self, source, target):\n        disk = self.towers[source].pop()\n        if disk:\n            self.towers[target].push(disk)\n            self.move_stack.append((source, target))\n\n    def solve(self, num_disks, source, target, auxiliary):\n        if num_disks == 1:\n            self.move_disk(source, target)\n        else:\n            self.solve(num_disks - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n            self.move_disk(source, target)\n            self.solve(num_disks - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n\n    def undo(self):\n        if self.move_stack:\n            source, target = self.move_stack.pop()\n            disk = self.towers[target].pop()\n            if disk:\n                self.towers[source].push(disk)\n```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe design of the `HanoiGame`, `Tower`, and `Disk` classes provides a clear and organized structure for implementing the Towers of Hanoi puzzle. By utilizing encapsulation, we can manage the complexity of the game logic effectively. The interactions between the classes facilitate a modular approach, making it easier to extend or modify the game in the future. The use of methods for game operations, along with a stack for undo functionality, enhances the user experience and maintains the integrity of the game state.",
        "To design a `HanoiGame` class that orchestrates the gameplay of the Towers of Hanoi, we will first define the necessary classes: `Tower`, `Disk`, and `HanoiGame`. Below is a structured approach to implementing this game, along with justifications for using classes and encapsulation.\n\n### Class Definitions\n\n1. **Disk Class**: Represents a disk in the Towers of Hanoi.\n2. **Tower Class**: Represents a tower that can hold disks.\n3. **HanoiGame Class**: Manages the game state, including the towers and the gameplay logic.\n\n### Implementation\n\n```python\nclass Disk:\n    def __init__(self, size):\n        self.size = size\n\nclass Tower:\n    def __init__(self, name):\n        self.name = name\n        self.disks = []\n\n    def add_disk(self, disk):\n        if self.disks and self.disks[-1].size < disk.size:\n            raise ValueError(\"Cannot place larger disk on top of smaller disk.\")\n        self.disks.append(disk)\n\n    def remove_disk(self):\n        if not self.disks:\n            raise ValueError(\"No disks to remove.\")\n        return self.disks.pop()\n\n    def __str__(self):\n        return f\"{self.name}: \" + \" \".join(str(disk.size) for disk in reversed(self.disks))\n\nclass HanoiGame:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.towers = [Tower(\"A\"), Tower(\"B\"), Tower(\"C\")]\n        self.moves_stack = []\n        self.total_disks = 0\n\n    def initialize_game(self, num_disks):\n        self.total_disks = num_disks\n        for size in range(num_disks, 0, -1):\n            self.towers[0].add_disk(Disk(size))\n\n    def display_state(self):\n        for tower in self.towers:\n            print(tower)\n\n    def move_disk(self, from_tower, to_tower):\n        disk = self.towers[from_tower].remove_disk()\n        self.towers[to_tower].add_disk(disk)\n        self.moves_stack.append((from_tower, to_tower))\n\n    def undo_move(self):\n        if not self.moves_stack:\n            print(\"No moves to undo.\")\n            return\n        from_tower, to_tower = self.moves_stack.pop()\n        disk = self.towers[to_tower].remove_disk()\n        self.towers[from_tower].add_disk(disk)\n\n    def solve(self, n, source, target, auxiliary):\n        if n == 1:\n            self.move_disk(source, target)\n            return\n        self.solve(n - 1, source, auxiliary, target)\n        self.move_disk(source, target)\n        self.solve(n - 1, auxiliary, target, source)\n\n# Example usage\ngame = HanoiGame()\ngame.initialize_game(3)\ngame.display_state()\ngame.solve(3, 0, 2, 1)  # Solve the puzzle\ngame.display_state()\n```\n\n### Justification for Using Classes\n\n1. **Encapsulation**: \n   - Each class encapsulates its own data and behavior. The `Disk` class manages the size of the disk, while the `Tower` class manages the collection of disks. The `HanoiGame` class orchestrates the game logic, keeping the implementation details hidden from the user. This separation of concerns simplifies the management of complex game logic.\n\n2. **Clear Structure**:\n   - The interactions between `Tower`, `Disk`, and `HanoiGame` create a clear structure. The `HanoiGame` class interacts with `Tower` objects to manage the state of the game, while `Tower` objects manage their own `Disk` objects. This hierarchy allows for easy modifications and extensions, such as adding new features or changing the game rules.\n\n3. **Maintainability**:\n   - By using classes, the code is more maintainable. If changes are needed (e.g., adding a new feature), they can often be made within a single class without affecting others. This modularity is crucial for larger projects.\n\n4. **Reusability**:\n   - The classes can be reused in different contexts. For example, the `Disk` and `Tower` classes could be used in other games or applications that require similar functionality.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe `HanoiGame` class, along with the `Tower` and `Disk` classes, provides a robust framework for managing the Towers of Hanoi game. The use of classes enhances encapsulation, maintainability, and reusability, making the code easier to understand and modify. The interactions between the classes create a clear and organized structure that effectively manages the complexity of the game logic."
