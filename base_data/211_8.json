    "original_prompt": "\ud83d\ude80 Welcome to BRICS: Elite Soldier 2.0: Tactical Edition \ud83c\udfae\n\nImmerse yourself in a dystopian future where BRICS nations hold global supremacy. You are not just a soldier; you're a leader from one  of BRICS  nations  commanding an elite team. Your decisions will shape your environment, influence your relationships with team members and other characters, and impact the survival of your team.\n\nEach team member starts with 100 Hit Points (HP). Each action may put a percentage of your team's HP at risk. You'll also manage their Stress levels, which will increase from challenging combat and difficult decisions. High Stress can lead to negative effects, and if a member's Stress reaches the maximum, they may become unresponsive or rogue.\n\nMeet Ursus \ud83e\udd16, your AI companion. Ursus is a strategist, confidant, and customizable ally. Tailor Ursus' traits to complement your leadership style. Additionally, Ursus will help manage the team's stress levels and overall morale.\n\nEquip your team with weapons, armor, and special items. Use the USE <item> command to deploy an item tactically during missions. Every mission brings chances for loot, including items, equipment, and artifacts that can provide your team an edge. Use INVENTORY command to manage your team's gear.\n\nInteract using the letter or number linked to your choice. For additional insights, use ASK <Your Question>. MULL_OVER prompts Ursus for analysis, and INQUIRE gives hints.\n\nKeep track of your team's HP and Stress levels with TEAM_CHECK. If a member's HP drops to zero, they're incapacitated. If the entire team's HP drops to zero, it's GAME OVER, and you must RESTART.\n\nSave your progress with SAVE. Each save offers a comprehensive summary of your team's status, achievements, potential challenges, current HP, Stress levels, and inventory.\n\nSpecial commands:\n\n    BEGIN: Start your mission.\n    STATS: Examine your team's status.\n    RESET: Restart from scratch.\n    REWIND: Undo a previous decision.\n    INPUT: Offer feedback for a tailored experience.\n    ADVANCE: Proceed to the next scenario.\n    HP_CHECK: Verify your current HP.\n    USE <item>: Use an item from your inventory.\n    INVENTORY: Check your current inventory.\n    TEAM_CHECK: Check your team's HP and Stress levels.\n\nIn the world of BRICS supremacy, will you rise to the occasion, strategically leading your team against all odds? Or will the harsh realities of the future grind down your squad? The journey begins now.\n",

Your team has lost 20 HP each, and their Stress levels have spiked due to the unexpected ambush. You must choose whether to retreat and regroup, risking further loss of morale, or push forward to gather intel on enemy movements, which could potentially lower the enemy's HP but may increase your team's Stress even more.

However, the area is crawling with enemy patrols, and your team is already at 70 HP each with high Stress from previous encounters.

        "As the commander of the Russian tactical unit, you must weigh the risks and rewards carefully. Here are your options:\n\n1. **Stealthily Acquire the Weapons**: Attempt to sneak in and secure the advanced weaponry. This could significantly enhance your team's capabilities, but there's a high risk of triggering an alarm, which could lead to a dangerous confrontation.\n\n2. **Bypass the Cache**: Choose a safer route to your objective, avoiding the potential dangers of the cache. This would keep your team safe but may leave you under-equipped for future encounters.\n\nWhat will you decide? Please respond with either \"1\" to attempt to acquire the weapons or \"2\" to bypass the cache.",
        "In this high-stakes situation, I will carefully assess the risks and benefits of both options before making a decision. Given that the team is already at 70 HP each and experiencing high Stress, it's crucial to prioritize their safety and morale.\n\n**Decision: Attempt to stealthily acquire the weapons.**\n\n1. **Team Check:** First, I will issue a TEAM_CHECK command to confirm the current HP and Stress levels of my team. This will help me gauge how much risk we can afford to take.\n\n2. **Stealth Approach:** If the HP and Stress levels are manageable, I will instruct the team to move quietly towards the cache, using the terrain for cover. I will remind them to stay low and communicate silently.\n\n3. **Ursus' Input:** I will MULL_OVER the situation with Ursus to analyze the best approach for stealth. I will ask for insights on potential enemy patrol patterns and the best time to move.\n\n4. **Inventory Check:** Before proceeding, I will use the INVENTORY command to ensure we have any items that could aid in stealth, such as smoke grenades or silenced weapons.\n\n5. **Execute the Plan:** If everything checks out, I will give the command to advance towards the cache, instructing the team to be ready to retreat if things go awry. I will also prepare a contingency plan in case we trigger an alarm.\n\n6. **Monitor Stress Levels:** Throughout the operation, I will keep an eye on the team's Stress levels and be ready to adapt our strategy if they begin to rise too high.\n\nBy taking a calculated risk to acquire the advanced weaponry, we could significantly enhance our capabilities for future encounters, but I will remain vigilant and prepared to pivot if the situation escalates."
