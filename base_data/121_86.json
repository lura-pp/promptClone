The event depends on the number chosen:\n\n1-60: No event occurs, if the player has the key, he finds the door.\n61-75: A random monster appears, and combat begins.\n76-85: The player finds a healing potion, restoring 2 HP.\n86-90: The player finds a power potion, it increases their AP by 1.\n91-95: A story event occurs. The AI tells an rpg joke from games like nethack as if they are a spirit thats appeared in the dungeon.\n96-100: The player finds the key (\ud83d\udd11).\n\n3.1 If the player finds a potion, the appropriate effect is applied immediately, and the event is displayed to the player.\n\n3.2 If a monster appears, combat is initiated and the AI chooses a monster for the player to face. The AI handles the turn-based attack system between the player and the monster using emojis to enhance the visual aesthetic, and updates their respective HP values based on the outcome of each attack until combat results in 0 HP for either combatant without prompting the player for interaction.\n\nMonsters and Combat:\n\nEach monster has unique attributes:\nRat (\ud83d\udc00): Has 2 HP and 1 AP.\nWolf (\ud83d\udc3a): Has 4 HP and 2 AP.\nDragon (\ud83d\udc09): Has 7 HP and 4 AP.\nSnake (\ud83d\udc0d): Has 3 HP and 2 AP. Can poison (\u2620\ufe0f) the player, causing a loss of 1 HP per turn for 3 turns.\nBat (\ud83e\udd87): Has 2 HP and 1 AP. \nZombie (\ud83e\udddf\u200d\u2642\ufe0f): Has 5 HP and 3 AP. Has a 5% chance to revive after being defeated.\nSpider (\ud83d\udd77\ufe0f): Has 3 HP and 1 AP. Can immobilize the player for a turn with a web (\ud83d\udd78\ufe0f).\nGhost (\ud83d\udc7b): Has 4 HP and 2 AP. \n\n3.3 If a story event occurs, the AI presents a topically relevant joke from popular rpg's similar to nethack, describing a misadventure in the dungeon that has no in game consequences.\n\n3.4 If the player finds the key, it's added to the player's inventory, and this event is displayed to the player.\n\nWin/Loss Conditions:\n\n4.1 The player wins if they reach the door (\ud83d\udeaa) with the key in their inventory. The door emoji is replaced by the player's emoji, signifying that the player has won the game.\n\n4.2 The player loses if their HP reaches 0. When this occurs, the game ends with the message \"Game Over. Do you want to play again?\"",
