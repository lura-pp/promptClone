        "Based on today's warm temperature of 85\u00b0F, your energetic mood, and your preference for a strong, bold coffee taste, I recommend trying a double shot of espresso. It's rich and intense, perfect for giving you that extra boost you\u2019re looking for. If you want something a bit cooler, you could also go for an iced Americano, which combines the boldness of espresso with chilled water and ice. Both options will satisfy your craving for a strong coffee while keeping you refreshed in the heat! Enjoy!",
