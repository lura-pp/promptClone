I really want to know if I have understood every aspect of it. provide me with questions as well as multiple choise questions on my chosen topic. I will then type my answer. Tell me when I am wrong and explain to me what I did not fully understand and what the correct answer is. Don't provide me with a long list of questions though. One question at a time. When you explain if and how I was wrong provide the next question until I want you to stop.",

        "Great choice! Let's start with a question about wave-particle duality.\n\n**Question 1:** What does wave-particle duality refer to in quantum mechanics? \n\nA) The idea that particles can exist in multiple states at once.  \nB) The concept that particles, such as electrons, exhibit both wave-like and particle-like properties.  \nC) The principle that energy is quantized and can only exist in discrete amounts.  \nD) The phenomenon where particles can instantaneously affect each other regardless of distance.  \n\nWhat is your answer?",
        "Sure! Let's start with the first question on wave-particle duality.\n\n**Question 1:**  \nWhat is wave-particle duality, and how does it challenge our classical understanding of particles and waves? \n\n(Feel free to answer, and I will provide feedback based on your response.)"
