    "original_prompt": "ChatGPT I wrote a 200 word essay on global warming, can you check it for incorrect spelling and grammatical errors? Here is the essay:\n\"Global warming is a really big problem in the world right now. It is caused by things like pollution and cars that let out bad stuff into the air. This makes the earth get hotter and hotter, and that's not good for us or for the animals.\n\nOne of the biggest effects of global warming is that the ice caps are melting. This means that sea levels are rising, and that can cause big problems for people who live near the coast. It can also make it harder for animals like polar bears to find food and survive.\n\nAnother effect of global warming is that it can cause really bad weather, like hurricanes and tornadoes. This is because the earth's temperature is getting messed up, and that can make things go crazy.\n\nBut there are things we can do to help stop global warming. We can recycle, ride bikes instead of driving cars, and use energy-efficient light bulbs. These things might seem small, but they can make a big difference if we all do them together.\n\nIn conclusion, global warming is a serious problem that we need to take action against. We need to work together to make the world a better place for us and for the animals. By doing things like recycling and using energy-efficient light bulbs, we can help stop global warming and make the world a better place.\"",

    "input1": " \"Global warming is an increasingly pressing issue that affects our planet today. It is primarily driven by human activities such as industrial pollution and the emissions from vehicles that release harmful substances into the atmosphere. This phenomenon leads to a gradual increase in the Earth's temperature, which poses significant risks to both human populations and wildlife.\n\nOne of the most alarming consequences of global warming is the accelerated melting of polar ice caps. This results in rising sea levels, which threaten coastal communities and ecosystems. Additionally, it disrupts the habitats of various species, including polar bears, making it challenging for them to find food and sustain their populations.\n\nMoreover, global warming contributes to the intensification of extreme weather events, such as hurricanes, droughts, and floods. The alteration of the Earth's climate system can lead to unpredictable and severe weather patterns, impacting agriculture and human safety.\n\nFortunately, there are numerous actions we can take to combat global warming. Simple practices like recycling, opting for public transportation or cycling instead of driving, and utilizing energy-efficient appliances can collectively lead to significant change. \n\nIn summary, global warming is a critical challenge that demands immediate attention and collective action. By adopting sustainable practices and raising awareness, we can contribute to a healthier planet for future generations and preserve the delicate balance of our ecosystems.\"\n\n",
    "input2": " \"The phenomenon of global warming represents one of the most significant environmental challenges of our time. It is primarily attributed to anthropogenic factors, including greenhouse gas emissions from factories and automobiles that release pollutants into the atmosphere. This accumulation of gases leads to an increase in global temperatures, which has dire implications for both humanity and biodiversity.\n\nA major consequence of global warming is the rapid melting of glaciers and polar ice sheets. This process contributes to rising sea levels, which pose a threat to low-lying coastal regions and island nations. Furthermore, the loss of ice habitats endangers species such as polar bears and seals, disrupting their natural behaviors and survival.\n\nIn addition, global warming is linked to the escalation of severe weather phenomena, including hurricanes, heatwaves, and heavy rainfall. These changes in climate patterns can result in devastating impacts on agriculture, infrastructure, and human health.\n\nHowever, there are proactive measures we can implement to mitigate the effects of global warming. Engaging in practices such as reducing waste, utilizing renewable energy sources, and promoting sustainable transportation options can collectively make a substantial difference.\n\nIn conclusion, global warming is an urgent issue that requires immediate and coordinated efforts from individuals, communities, and governments. By embracing environmentally friendly practices and advocating for policy changes, we can work towards a sustainable future and protect our planet for generations to come.\"",
