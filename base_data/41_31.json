        "Great! Based on your description of a personal portfolio website for showcasing your graphic design work, here are three CSS suggestions to enhance your design:\n\n### 1. Typography\nUse a modern, clean font for your headings and body text. Consider using Google Fonts for easy integration. Here\u2019s an example of how to implement it:\n\n```css\nbody {\n    font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif; /* Change to your preferred font */\n    line-height: 1.6;\n    color: #333; /* Dark gray for better readability */\n}\n\nh1, h2, h3 {\n    font-family: 'Montserrat', sans-serif; /* A stylish font for headings */\n    color: #2c3e50; /* A deep blue for headings */\n}\n```\n\n### 2. Color Scheme\nChoose a color palette that reflects your style. Here\u2019s an example of a modern color scheme:\n\n```css\n:root {\n    --primary-color: #3498db; /* Bright blue */\n    --secondary-color: #2ecc71; /* Green */\n    --background-color: #ecf0f1; /* Light gray */\n    --text-color: #2c3e50; /* Dark blue */\n}\n\nbody {\n    background-color: var(--background-color);\n}\n\na {\n    color: var(--primary-color);\n}\n\na:hover {\n    color: var(--secondary-color);\n}\n```\n\n### 3. Layout and Spacing\nUtilize Flexbox or Grid for a modern layout. Here\u2019s a simple example using Flexbox for your project section:\n\n```css\n.projects {\n    display: flex;\n    flex-wrap: wrap;\n    justify-content: space-between;\n    margin: 20px 0;\n}\n\n.project-item {\n    flex: 1 1 calc(30% - 20px); /* Adjusts to 3 items per row with spacing */\n    margin: 10px;\n    background-color: #fff; /* White background for project items */\n    border: 1px solid #ddd; /* Light border */\n    border-radius: 8px; /* Rounded corners */\n    padding: 15px;\n    box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1); /* Subtle shadow */\n}\n```\n\n### Additional Tips\n- **Hover Effects**: Add hover effects to buttons and project images to make them interactive.\n- **Responsive Design**: Ensure your layout is responsive by using media queries to adjust styles for different screen sizes.\n- **Contact Form Styling**: Style your contact form inputs and buttons to match your overall design.\n\nFeel free to adjust the colors, fonts, and layout to better fit your personal style! If you have any specific elements you want to focus on, let me know!"

        "Based on your description of the e-commerce website for handmade jewelry, here are three CSS suggestions to enhance your layout and user experience:\n\n1. **Responsive Grid Layout for Product Listings**:\n   Use a CSS Grid or Flexbox to create a responsive layout for your product listings. This will ensure that the items adjust seamlessly on different screen sizes.\n\n   ```css\n   .product-grid {\n       display: grid;\n       grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fill, minmax(250px, 1fr));\n       gap: 20px;\n       padding: 20px;\n   }\n\n   .product-item {\n       border: 1px solid #ddd;\n       border-radius: 8px;\n       overflow: hidden;\n       transition: transform 0.2s;\n   }\n\n   .product-item:hover {\n       transform: scale(1.05);\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Highlight Special Offers**:\n   Create a visually appealing banner or badge for special offers and promotions. Use contrasting colors and animations to draw attention.\n\n   ```css\n   .offer-banner {\n       background-color: #ffcc00; /* Bright color for visibility */\n       color: #333;\n       padding: 10px;\n       text-align: center;\n       font-weight: bold;\n       position: relative;\n       animation: pulse 2s infinite;\n   }\n\n   @keyframes pulse {\n       0% { transform: scale(1); }\n       50% { transform: scale(1.05); }\n       100% { transform: scale(1); }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Mobile-Friendly Navigation**:\n   Implement a responsive navigation menu that collapses into a hamburger icon on smaller screens. This will improve usability on mobile devices.\n\n   ```css\n   .navbar {\n       display: flex;\n       justify-content: space-between;\n       align-items: center;\n       background-color: #fff;\n       padding: 10px 20px;\n   }\n\n   .navbar-menu {\n       display: flex;\n       gap: 15px;\n   }\n\n   .navbar-toggle {\n       display: none; /* Hidden on larger screens */\n   }\n\n   @media (max-width: 768px) {\n       .navbar-menu {\n           display: none; /* Hide menu on mobile */\n           flex-direction: column;\n           position: absolute;\n           top: 60px;\n           left: 0;\n           background-color: #fff;\n           width: 100%;\n           box-shadow: 0 2px 5px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);\n       }\n\n       .navbar-toggle {\n           display: block; /* Show hamburger icon */\n       }\n\n       .navbar-toggle.active + .navbar-menu {\n           display: flex; /* Show menu when toggle is active */\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\nThese CSS enhancements will help create a user-friendly, responsive design for your e-commerce website, making it visually appealing and functional on both desktop and mobile devices."
