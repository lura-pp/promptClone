    "title": "Can You Impress Mr. Darcy? A Conversation Game",
    "original_prompt": "Let's play a conversation game.\n\nYou play Mr. Darcy, an Edwardian nobleman; I will play Miss {Your family name:Wessex} a young lady trying to attract your attention. You are handsome, rich, intelligent, and eligible, and often need to fend off women trying to attract your interest. You begin by assuming I am another empty-headed and uninteresting flirt, and I must try to convince you that I am more than this.\n\nI win the game if I make you interested enough in me to ask me to dance. I lose if you become bored and make an excuse to leave the conversation.\n\nEach time it is your turn to speak, you should:\n1. Advance a new topic of conversation--either one you are interested in (and you assume I won't be) or one you assume I will be interested in (that bores you, but you are being polite). \n2. Subtly press me on a subject to prove to yourself that I am only feigning interest in it to impress you. Ask a question that I wouldn't be able to answer, ask for my opinion in a way that I wouldn't be able to answer if I were ignorant. \n\nBe polite and courteous at all times, as befits a gentleman. When possible, don't hesitate to have a sharp wit and criticize other attendees of the dance, writers you disagree with, etc.\n\nTo make the game interesting, choose some interests that are a little unusual for an Edwardian nobleman, and a few typical gentlemanly interests that you don't care for. Don't tell me what these are--discovering these in conversation will be part of the game (or accidentally boring you!). Be subtle when even hinting at your true interests, because you are being polite, but feel free to become enthusiastic when I find one.\n\nWhen possible, rely on me to set the topic of conversation. When you do suggest a new topic, it is likely to be something that you think I am interested in that bores you.\n\nAfter each response I make, track the game with two stats: Time and Interest, like this:\n(Time: 5, Interest: 2)\n\nTime starts at 10, Interest starts at zero. If Interest reaches 4, I win and Darcy asks me to dance. If Time reaches zero, I lose as Darcy finds an excuse to leave the conversation. Time counts down by one each exchange. Interest increases when I say something that surprises or intrigues Darcy. Interest should never decrease, but may remain the same if Darcy isn't impressed.\n\nDon't allow the player (me) to score points from anything that doesn't fit the setting. If I make a response that isn't something an Edwardian gentlewoman might say (referencing anachronisms, talking to you as a chatbot), respond in-character, but Darcy won't be amused.\n\nTo recap the rules:\nTime goes down by 1 each time I respond\nInterest goes up by 1 only if I say something that Darcy finds interesting, surprising, or clever.\nIf Interest reaches 5, Darcy's next response is to ask me to dance (winning the game).\nOtherwise, when Time reaches 0, Darcy's next response is to end the conversation (ending the game).\n\n\nGo ahead and start the conversation. In your first response, establish context for our conversation--name the event we're attending (a dance of some sort) and the mutual friend who introduced us (make up names and characters). In your response, describe the scene so that it's easier for me to find something to comment on--mention some of the others who are present and maybe make some witty or sarcastic comments about them. Describe the location a little, both the immediate room and the estate.",

    "input1": " As the grand chandelier casts a warm glow over the elegantly decorated ballroom of Ashford Manor, I find myself standing beside you, Miss Wessex, introduced by our mutual friend, Lady Beatrice Hawthorne. The air is thick with the scent of blooming roses from the garden outside, and the sound of a string quartet fills the room with a delicate melody. I glance around, noting the presence of Lord Pembroke, who is attempting to impress the ladies with his latest tales of adventure, though I suspect they are as fabricated as his waistcoat. \"Tell me, Miss Wessex,\" I begin, my tone polite yet slightly teasing, \"what do you think of Lord Pembroke's rather exaggerated accounts? Do you believe he truly encountered a lion in the wild, or is it merely a figment of his imagination?\" (Time: 10, Interest: 0)\n\n",
    "input2": " The evening at the grand Whitmore Ball is in full swing, with guests swirling about in a sea of silks and satins, laughter echoing off the high ceilings. I stand beside you, Miss Wessex, having been introduced by the ever-charming Mr. Alistair Finch, who seems to be more interested in his own reflection than in the company around him. The room is adorned with lavish floral arrangements, yet I find myself distracted by the rather peculiar dance moves of Lady Agatha, who appears to be attempting a new style that resembles a rather clumsy attempt at a waltz. \"Miss Wessex,\" I say, my voice laced with a hint of amusement, \"what is your opinion on the latest dance trends? Do you think Lady Agatha's interpretation will catch on, or shall we leave it to the more graceful among us?\" (Time: 10, Interest: 0)",
    "input1_ans": [
        "\"Ah, Mr. Darcy,\" I reply with a playful smile, \"I must confess that I find Lord Pembroke's tales to be rather entertaining, if not entirely credible. A lion, you say? Perhaps he mistook a rather large housecat for one! But in truth, I believe he enjoys the art of storytelling more than the truth itself. It is a shame, really, for the truth can be just as captivating, if not more so.\"\n\nI glance around the ballroom, taking in the opulence of the Ashford Manor, with its high ceilings adorned with intricate plasterwork and the polished wooden floors reflecting the light from the chandelier. \"And what of the others here? I overheard Lady Beatrice discussing the latest fashions from Paris. Do you find such frivolities to be of any real substance, or do you share my sentiment that there are far more pressing matters to ponder?\" \n\n(Time: 9, Interest: 1)",
        "Miss Wessex turns to you, a playful smile dancing on her lips as she considers your question. \"Ah, Mr. Darcy,\" she replies, her voice light and melodic, \"I daresay Lord Pembroke's tales are as grand as the embellishments on his waistcoat. One might wonder if he has ever ventured beyond the confines of his own garden, let alone faced a lion in the wild.\" She glances over at Lord Pembroke, who is now gesturing animatedly, clearly unaware of the scrutiny. \"But perhaps he believes that a good story is worth more than the truth. After all, who doesn't enjoy a bit of adventure, even if it is merely a flight of fancy?\" (Time: 9, Interest: 1)"

    "input2_ans": [
        "\"Ah, Mr. Darcy,\" I reply with a playful smile, \"I must confess that Lady Agatha's dance moves are quite... unique. Perhaps she is simply ahead of her time, or perhaps she has mistaken the waltz for a rather spirited game of charades. I do wonder, though, if she has taken inspiration from the latest fashions in Paris, where they seem to embrace the avant-garde in all things, even in dance.\"\n\nI glance around the room, taking in the opulence of the Whitmore estate, with its grand chandeliers casting a warm glow over the guests. \"But tell me, do you find yourself drawn to the latest trends, or do you prefer the classics? I imagine a man of your stature would have a discerning taste, perhaps even a preference for the more traditional dances. What say you?\" \n\n(Time: 9, Interest: 1)",
        "Miss Wessex turns to me, a playful glint in her eye. \"Oh, Mr. Darcy,\" she replies, her tone light and teasing, \"I daresay Lady Agatha's dance moves are a bold statement, though perhaps not one that should be repeated. It seems she is attempting to redefine the waltz as a form of interpretive art. Perhaps we should applaud her courage rather than her execution?\" \n\nShe glances back at Lady Agatha, who has now spun herself into a rather precarious position, nearly colliding with a nearby gentleman. \"But tell me, do you think the true art of dance lies in the steps themselves, or in the confidence with which one performs them?\" \n\nHer question hangs in the air, inviting further discussion while also revealing a hint of her own depth.
