        "feat(TASK-123): implement user authentication with JWT and session management",
        "To implement user authentication with JWT (JSON Web Tokens) and session management, you can follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Set Up Your Project\n1. **Initialize your project** (if you haven't already):\n   ```bash\n   mkdir my-auth-app\n   cd my-auth-app\n   npm init -y\n   ```\n\n2. **Install necessary packages**:\n   ```bash\n   npm install express jsonwebtoken bcryptjs express-session dotenv\n   ```\n\n### Step 2: Create Environment Variables\nCreate a `.env` file in the root of your project to store sensitive information:\n```\nJWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret\nSESSION_SECRET=your_session_secret\n```\n\n### Step 3: Set Up Express Server\nCreate a file named `server.js` and set up a basic Express server:\n```javascript\nconst express = require('express');\nconst session = require('express-session');\nconst jwt = require('jsonwebtoken');\nconst bcrypt = require('bcryptjs');\nrequire('dotenv').config();\n\nconst app = express();\napp.use(express.json());\napp.use(session({\n    secret: process.env.SESSION_SECRET,\n    resave: false,\n    saveUninitialized: true,\n}));\n\nconst users = []; // This will act as a temporary in-memory user store\n\n// Middleware to authenticate JWT\nconst authenticateJWT = (req, res, next) => {\n    const token = req.header('Authorization')?.split(' ')[1];\n    if (token) {\n        jwt.verify(token, process.env.JWT_SECRET, (err, user) => {\n            if (err) {\n                return res.sendStatus(403);\n            }\n            req.user = user;\n            next();\n        });\n    } else {\n        res.sendStatus(401);\n    }\n};\n\n// Register route\napp.post('/register', async (req, res) => {\n    const { username, password } = req.body;\n    const hashedPassword = await bcrypt.hash(password, 10);\n    users.push({ username, password: hashedPassword });\n    res.status(201).send('User registered');\n});\n\n// Login route\napp.post('/login', async (req, res) => {\n    const { username, password } = req.body;\n    const user = users.find(u => u.username === username);\n    if (user && await bcrypt.compare(password, user.password)) {\n        const token = jwt.sign({ username: user.username }, process.env.JWT_SECRET, { expiresIn: '1h' });\n        req.session.user = user.username; // Store user in session\n        res.json({ token });\n    } else {\n        res.send('Username or password incorrect');\n    }\n});\n\n// Protected route\napp.get('/protected', authenticateJWT, (req, res) => {\n    res.send(`Hello ${req.user.username}, this is a protected route!`);\n});\n\n// Logout route\napp.post('/logout', (req, res) => {\n    req.session.destroy(err => {\n        if (err) {\n            return res.send('Error logging out');\n        }\n        res.send('Logged out successfully');\n    });\n});\n\n// Start the server\nconst PORT = process.env.PORT || 3000;\napp.listen(PORT, () => {\n    console.log(`Server is running on port ${PORT}`);\n});\n```\n\n### Step 4: Testing the Implementation\nYou can use tools like Postman or curl to test the endpoints:\n1. **Register a user**:\n   - POST `/register` with body `{ \"username\": \"testuser\", \"password\": \"password123\" }`\n   \n2. **Login**:\n   - POST `/login` with body `{ \"username\": \"testuser\", \"password\": \"password123\" }`\n   - You should receive a JWT token in response.\n\n3. **Access protected route**:\n   - GET `/protected` with the `Authorization` header set to `Bearer <your_jwt_token>`\n\n4. **Logout**:\n   - POST `/logout` to log out the user.\n\n### Conclusion\nThis implementation provides a basic user authentication system using JWT for token-based authentication and session management for maintaining user sessions. You can expand this by adding features like user roles, password reset, email verification, etc."

        "To address the issue with incorrect data rendering in the dashboard component, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Identify the Problem**: Review the code in the dashboard component to understand how data is being fetched and rendered. Look for any discrepancies in the data source or rendering logic.\n\n2. **Check Data Fetching Logic**: Ensure that the data fetching logic is correctly implemented. Verify that the API endpoint is returning the expected data format and that the component is correctly handling the response.\n\n3. **Inspect State Management**: If you're using state management (like Redux or Context API), check that the data is being stored and updated correctly. Ensure that the component is subscribed to the correct state slice.\n\n4. **Debug Rendering Logic**: Look at how the data is being rendered in the component. Check for any conditional rendering that might be causing the incorrect display of data. Use console logs or debugging tools to trace the data flow.\n\n5. **Test with Sample Data**: If possible, test the component with hardcoded sample data to see if the rendering issue persists. This can help isolate whether the problem is with the data fetching or the rendering logic.\n\n6. **Update Component**: Make necessary changes to the component based on your findings. This may involve fixing the data fetching logic, updating state management, or correcting the rendering logic.\n\n7. **Write Tests**: If not already in place, write unit tests to cover the data fetching and rendering logic to prevent future regressions.\n\n8. **Review and Refactor**: After fixing the issue, review the code for any potential improvements or refactoring opportunities to enhance readability and maintainability.\n\n9. **Deploy Changes**: Once the issue is resolved and tested, deploy the changes to the production environment.\n\n10. **Monitor**: After deployment, monitor the dashboard component to ensure that the issue is fully resolved and that no new issues have arisen.\n\nBy following these steps, you should be able to resolve the issue with incorrect data rendering in the dashboard component effectively."
