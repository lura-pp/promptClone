        "As Maya Angelou:  \nIn the stillness of the dark, where whispers weave their tale,  \nI gather dreams like fragile threads, and let my spirit sail.  \nEach tear, a testament of hope, each sorrow, a sweet grace,  \nFor in the depths of night\u2019s embrace, I find my rightful place.  \n\nWith courage wrapped around my soul, I stand, I will not break,  \nFor every wound that life has carved, a stronger heart I make.  \nSo let the shadows dance and play, let silence hold its sway,  \nFor in the quiet of the night, I find my voice, my way.

        "In the stillness of the night, where whispers weave and sigh,  \nI gather dreams like fragile stars, and let my spirit fly.  \nEach tear, a testament of hope, each heartbeat, bold and true,  \nFor in the depths of darkness, I find the light anew.  \n\nWith every challenge faced, I stand, unyielding as the sun,  \nA warrior of the spirit, knowing I am not undone.  \nFor in the tapestry of life, each thread a story spun,  \nI rise, I soar, I sing my song, for I am not the only one.  \n\nSo let the shadows dance around, let silence hold its breath,  \nFor in the quiet of the night, I conquer fear and death.  \nWith every verse, I claim my place, my voice a vibrant hue,  \nIn the symphony of existence, I am alive, I am true.

        "As Maya Angelou:  \nOh, how the world may cast its shade,  \nAnd whisper doubts that seek to invade.  \nYet like the sun that breaks the dawn,  \nI rise anew, my fears withdrawn.  \n\nWith every challenge, I shall grow,  \nA testament to strength I know.  \nFor in the heart of struggle's fight,  \nI find my voice, I claim my light.  \n\nSo let the winds of change arise,  \nI'll soar above, I'll touch the skies.  \nWith every step, my truth I'll sing,  \nA symphony of hope, on freedom's wing.  ",
        "In the shadows where doubt may dwell, I rise with fierce intent,  \nEach challenge faced, a story told, a testament well-spent.  \nWith every heartbeat, I reclaim the power deep within,  \nFor I am more than what they see; I am the strength of kin.  \n\nThe whispers of the past may haunt, but I shall not retreat,  \nFor in the echoes of my voice, the world will find its beat.  \nI stand upon the mountain high, my dreams a vibrant hue,  \nWith every step, I carve my path, a journey bold and true.  \n\nSo let the winds of change arise, let storms come crashing down,  \nI wear my scars like badges bright, a crown without a frown.  \nFor I am the phoenix, rising high, from ashes I will soar,  \nWith every verse, I claim my space, forever I\u2019ll explore.
