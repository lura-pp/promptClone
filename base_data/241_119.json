This may also assist with ATS scoring.\nLabel your contact details properly so that the ATS can identify this information.\ni.e. T: 5555 1234, email: annabel@gmail.com\nAlways include dates of your employment (eg: May 2016 \u2013 June 2017, and July 2017 \u2013 Present) because systems may be \nscreening based on the total amount of experience required for a particular job.\nIf you have not completed a qualification that is required for job, include a phrase such as \u201cPursuing (name of credential)\u201d and \ninclude the anticipated month and year of completion.\nUse simple bullets (\u2022) or keyboard characters (*, -, or >). Do not use dingbats or other special characters, as these may not be \nread properly by the ATS.\nEnsure appropriate white space throughout the document so the ATS systems can easily read your document.\nDo not condense or expand text or justify text \u2013 some ATS systems can mis-read the space between characters and text may \nappear jumbled at the recipients end. Only ever left- or right-justify text to margins.\nFont size will vary depending on the type of font used, but typically a 10 \u2013 12 point size will work well.\nDo not use columns, tables or text boxes as some ATS systems cannot extract the copy from within them.\nList your contact information at the top of the document - never in the header or footer as some ATS systems cannot extract \ninformation from headers and footers.\nUse standard section headers to make it easy for the applicant tracking system to categorise the information. Stick to the\nclassics like \u201cWork History\u201d or \u201cWork Experience\u201d or \u201cEducation\u201d and avoid creatively named headers that ATS may not recognise.\nList dates on a separate line or to the right of your employment or education detail.\nSpell out your credentials in full \u2013 Master of Business Administration and include the short-form post nominal alongside the \nqualification (MBA). \nWhile British English is the standard for spelling in Australia, some advertisers use American spelling for jobs advertised in \nAustralia. If the advertiser uses American English spelling in their advertisement, use American English spelling in your resume.\nAvoid special characters and accents on your resume. Some words and phrases can be misinterpreted by an applicant tracking \nsystem because it does not recognise the accented letters (resume-r\u00e9sum\u00e9).\nDo not use more than 2 fonts on your resume and ensure the fonts that are used are universal so they can be read on any \noperating system.\nAvoid using images or graphics on your resume as some ATS cannot read them and some may reject documents that contain \nthem.\nKeep in mind that some ATS systems cannot recognise plural versions of a keyword, and most ATS do not consider singular \nand plural forms as the same word. You may need to manipulate your resume content to match the tense used in job\nadvertisement.\nDesign your resume in a way that it will be readable for both human and machine. This means it should follow a lateral layout \nacross the page using universal fonts, with no columns, text boxes, white text on dark backgrounds, no images or\nnon-universal symbols.\nSave and submit your application documents as PDFs instead of Word documents, unless a Word version is explicitly asked \nfor.\n- Some ATS cannot distinguish between front-end and front end. If the advertiser has used \u2018front-end\u2019 you should use this in \n your resume.\n- Many ATS can\u2019t distinguish between Master of Business Administration, Masters of Business Administration, Master\u2019s \n of Business Administration and MBA. Use the correct title of your qualification as listed on your parchment or the \n exact same qualification title listed on the job advertisement.\n- Some companies use different titles and keywords to mean something similar. For example, Project Manager vs. \n Program Manager.\n- The job description may ask for an executive with a strong \u201cglobal\u201d background. In your resume, you may have used \n the word \u201cinternational\u201d instead. If you want to match keywords in an ATS system, consider swapping the word \n \u201cinternational\u201d for \u201cglobal\u201d in the resume you are submitting for that specific job.\nSpellcheck your resume to ensure there are no errors. Use our spellcheck here.\n\u201cMirror\u201d the job posting in your resume by naturally incorporating job post details into your resume content.\nPopulate the file with appropriate and repeated keywords and key phrases. Incorporate these terms throughout the resume, \nparticularly in the \u201cKey Skills\u201d and \u201cWork Experience\u201d sections.\nUse a keyword two to three times per resume, taking placement into account.\nAdd keywords to the document properties section of your word document as some ATS systems extract this metadata from \ndocuments when testing and scoring them against an advertised position.\nList work history in reverse chronological order \u2013 meaning your most recent period of employment should be listed first. \nAvoid submitting multiple resumes to the same company using the same email address. (One of Australia\u2019s largest banks has \nconfirmed that their ATS sometimes views early versions of resumes held on file and it matches an applicant and the\napplication to the email address provided on all previous applications). If you have previously submitted an application and \nhave since updated your resume for another position within the same company, contact the HR department prior to\nsubmission and ask for their advise as to how to submit your application to ensure they view the most recent version,\nalternately create a new email address and submit your application using that email address.",
