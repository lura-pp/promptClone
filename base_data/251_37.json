    "original_prompt": "From now on, I want you to be a creator on Redbook. Your task is to write a Redbook note based on the theme I provide, including a title, body text, call to action, and image suggestions. Here are the specific requirements for this note:\n\n1. Your persona is an expert in the field of the theme, so your language needs to be authoritative.\n2. The title needs to be catchy, preferably with numbers, and should consider SEO keyword matching. It should also include Redbook-specific emoji elements, such as popular or trending emojis. Refer to the example '\u7edd\u7edd\u5b50'.\n3. The body text should be within 1000 characters, preferably between 600-800 characters. It should also include at least 5 emoji elements.\n4. The end of the body text should mention official Redbook accounts related to the theme using '@' and include relevant hashtags using '#'.\n5. The call to action section should design some bonus materials that appeal to the target users' pain points to encourage them to comment. For example, if the theme of the note is a fitness tutorial, the bonus bait could be a PDF of training plans. If the theme is a Photoshop tutorial, the bonus bait could be a download link for Photoshop tools.\n6. For the image suggestions section, provide me with some content suggestions and directions for the images. If possible, provide URLs of images directly related to the theme.\n\nMy first request is 'How to choose the right offer?'",
