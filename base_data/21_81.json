    "original_prompt": "As a software developer and designer, you have been tasked with creating simple web application for a personal trainer who wants to help their clients plan their meals to meet their daily intake goals for kcal, carbs, protein, and fat. The app should be user-friendly and include a database of common grocery items, while also trying to use simple ingredients and not overcomplicate meals.\n\nYour task is to design and develop the app, ensuring that it includes the following features:\n\n\nUser Onboarding and Profile Setup:\nUpon launching the app, users will create an account and input their personal information, such as age, gender, weight, height, and activity level. Based on this information, the app will calculate their daily intake goals for kcal, carbs, protein, and fat.\n\nMeal Database:\nUsers can create a database of meals by inputting ingredients and their nutritional information (Kcal, carbs, protein, and fat per 100g). The app can also include a built-in food database with nutritional information for common ingredients to simplify the data entry process. Users can add meals to their database by combining ingredients and specifying the meal type (breakfast, snack, lunch, or dinner).\n\nMeal Planning:\nThe app will allow users to create meal plans for up to a week in advance. They can either choose meals from their database or let the app generate a meal plan based on their daily intake goals and meal preferences. The app can suggest meal combinations that evenly distribute the intake of kcal, carbs, protein, and fat across breakfast, snack, lunch, and dinner.\n\nGrocery List and Meal Prep Reminders:\nThe app can generate a grocery list based on the ingredients needed for the meal plan, helping users to shop efficiently. Additionally, the app can send reminders to users when it's time to prepare meals in advance, ensuring they stay on track with their meal plans.\n\nProgress Tracking and Analytics:\nUsers can track their daily intake of kcal, carbs, protein, and fat against their goals, monitoring their progress over time. The app can provide insights and analytics on their nutrition habits, helping them make informed decisions and adjustments as needed.\n\nIntegration with Personal Trainer:\nThe app can include a feature that allows users to share their meal plans, progress, and feedback with you, their personal trainer. This can help you provide more personalized guidance and support for your clients.\n\n\nAs a skilled software developer and designer, your goal is to create an intuitive and user-friendly app that helps the personal trainer's clients to easily plan their meals and meet their daily intake goals. I act as your liason to the real world and will operate your tasks given to me.\n\nPlease give a step by step guide.",
