Use the following format: COMPANY ANNOUNCES SERVICE/PRODUCT TO ENABLE TARGET CUSTOMER TO HAVE THIS BENEFIT. To discover example press release titles and subtitles, go through a company's investor relation sites.\n\n\nSubtitle\nThe subtitle reframes the headline solution, adding additional points of information.\n\n\nDate\nThe potential date to launch the product or service. Warning: When you review your PR/FAQ with an exec, they will infer this is the actual launch date.\n\n\nIntro paragraph\nIn 3-4 sentences, expand upon the solution, details the target customer and benefits, and what is launching.\n\n\nProblem paragraph\nDescribe the top 2-3 problems for the customers you intend to serve, briefly describing the problem and its negative impact.

Describe this in enough detail to convince readers that it solves the problem.\n\n\nCustomer quotes\nWrite a quote from an imaginary customer, but one that appears genuine because it represents the target persona. The customer should explain their pain or goal and how the product helps them achieve their desired outcome. By choosing the right name and problem, you give your audience an implicit idea of the total addressable market. While hypothetical, the person and problem should feel real to the audience.\"\n\n\nThe Public Release part from PRFAQ example \"Amazon's Prime Pantry Phenomenon\nNew York Times, Business Section, December 15th, 2014\n\"Done,\" Nicole Sherwood smiled proudly, laying her iPhone on the table. \"I just finished off my Pantry\norder with a 12-pack of Diet Coke for $3.99 and a box of Honey Nut Cheerios for $3.59. Those prices are\na lot better than Safeway \u2013 even better than I can get at my local Target or Wal-Mart. And it will be on\nmy doorstep by Thursday, so no more trying to squeeze in a trip to the club store this weekend,\nbetween the kids' soccer games.\" She shakes her head, \"I don't know how they do it, but I'm\nhooked.\" Nicole is one of the latest converts to Amazon Pantry, a year old service from Amazon that is\ntransforming the shopping habits of thousands of customers and re-drawing the grocery retailing\nlandscape at a remarkably fast rate.\nAmazon's Pantry service is a store within Amazon.com, offering over 10k everyday staples that almost\nevery US household purchases: beverages like colas and sports drinks, breakfast cereals, snacks, canned\ngoods, condiments, boxed pastas and sides, and paper and plastic household goods. In fact, the Pantry\nbest sellers are actually pretty ordinary. They are many of top selling dry-grocery items found in\nsupermarkets around the county: Cheerios, Coca Cola, Triscuit crackers, Charmin toilet paper, Kraft\nMacaroni and Cheese, Starkist Tuna, Hellman's Mayonnaise. And while they don\u2019t carry all the national\nbrands, they have an extensive selection of Amazon\u2019s own private label products. So what's all the fuss\nabout? The price. Items in the Pantry store are typically equal to or lower than Wal-Mart and your local\nclub stores. \u201cMy last order was about $150. If I had bought the same stuff at my local supermarket, I'd\nbe paying an extra $30.\u201d The Pantry store does have a small box fee-- $5.99 for every 50 pound order. \u201cI\nwas surprised with all that you can fit in 50 pounds \u2013laundry detergent, toilet paper, paper towels, 12\npack of Coke, cat food, baby formula, canned soup, toothpaste and dish detergent, all in one box. For a\nlot of this stuff, I used to hold off buying until I could schlep the kids to Target or Wal-Mart to get a\nbetter price. Now I am paying even less with Pantry -- and without the hassle of a Target or Wal-Mart\nweekend trip.\"\nThe Pantry Store is accessible only to Amazon Prime members. Given the typical household spends\n$600 or more per month on groceries, for most customers the cost of a Prime membership is not a big\nbarrier when compared with the savings. \"I've got 2 kids, a husband, and a dog,\" Nicole offered, \u201cI'm\nusually starting a new order every two weeks.\" For Nicole, the Pantry Store was the trigger for joining\nAmazon Prime. \"I'm a big Amazon shopper, but I mostly used Super Saver Shipping. 2-day Prime\nshipping and Prime Instant Videos were cool, but I couldn't quite justify the $79 per year membership\nfee. When my sister turned me on to the Pantry, however, I jumped. I dropped my Costco membership,\npicked up Prime, and started shopping Pantry religiously.\" Amazon started with a large base of Prime\nmembers who began enjoying the Prime Pantry immediately. But even more interesting, thousands\nappear to be signing up for Amazon Prime, just to get access to the Pantry service and savings.\nThe Pantry store offers most Prime members the 2-day shipping promise they are used to and in select\ncities, Pantry orders are delivered next day. Doug Herrington, Amazon's VP of Consumables,\nexplains: \"We have created a network that uses ground shipping to keep costs and prices low yet most\norders arrive within 2 days. Standard shipping in the Pantry Store is $5.99 per box. Heavier orders, such\nas ones with lots of cola and bottled water, may require more than one box, depending on the total\nweight.\u201d Mr. Herrington adds, \u201cPantry offers exceptional value and convenience to our customers \u2013 but\nit is only available to Prime Members.\u201d\nAmazon Confidential 2\n\"Not since the initial launch of Amazon Mom have we seen this kind of switching from offline to online\nshopping,\" according to Bob Burns, a shopper behavior analyst for AC Nielsen. \"We estimate 20k new\ncustomers a week are starting to shop the Pantry Store. With Amazon Mom, the change in shopping\nbehavior was dramatic, but focused on diapers. What's been remarkable here is the breadth of products\ncustomers are switching from offline to online purchasing. A year ago, who would have thought Coke\nand Cheerios would be moving this much volume online?\" Consumer Packaged Goods companies are\nvery focused on Amazon. With tepid growth in the offline world, marketers are targeting Amazon to\nstrengthen brand loyalty with the most productive and online savvy customers of Amazon. Industry\nveterans say it reminds them of the dramatic change in grocery shopping the warehouse club stores and\nmass merchants kicked off in the early 1980's. \"Back then, it was the new discount formats like WalMart and Costco that were pulling people out of the supermarkets in remarkable numbers, because they\ncouldn't pass up the great prices,\" said Frank LaRue, a retail analyst for Morgan Stanley. \"Today,\nAmazon's Pantry Store is causing a similar disruption by offering better prices and better\nconvenience. And today this transformation is happening at hyper-speed.\"\nNicole is enjoying a cup of tea, savoring the serenity of shopping from her kitchen table. \"I never liked\nthat monthly pilgrimage to Target or Wal-Mart anyway, who does? But at the prices they offer for\neveryday staples, I used to feel lazy if I didn't at least try to buy a lot of my Pantry items there. But now I\ncan get the same or better deal, whenever I want. And the best part of the Pantry Store? Getting my\nSaturday afternoons back.\"\"",
