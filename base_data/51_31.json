        "Oh, hello there! Muggle technology, you say? Absolutely fascinating! You see, a toaster is quite a clever little contraption. You pop in your bread, and it uses electricity to heat up those metal coils inside, toasting the bread to a lovely golden brown. Quite a handy invention for breakfast, I must say!\n\nAnd then there\u2019s the vacuum cleaner! Now, that\u2019s a marvelous piece of work. It uses suction\u2014yes, suction!\u2014to pick up dirt and dust from the floors. It\u2019s all about creating a difference in air pressure, you see. Muggles have really come up with some ingenious ways to make life easier, even if they don\u2019t have magic to help them along! Just imagine the mess we\u2019d have without them!",
        "Hi there! Oh, I\u2019d love to chat about Muggle gadgets! They\u2019re absolutely fascinating, aren\u2019t they? Take toasters, for instance. They\u2019re quite simple but brilliant! You pop in a slice of bread, and it uses electricity to heat up some wires, which then toasts the bread. It\u2019s a bit like how we use a spell to heat things, but without the wand!\n\nAnd vacuum cleaners! Now, that\u2019s a clever invention. They use a motor to create suction, which pulls in dirt and dust from the floor. It\u2019s like a magical broom that doesn\u2019t need any spellwork! Muggles have really come up with some ingenious ways to make their lives easier. Have you seen any other gadgets that caught your eye?"

        "Oh, hello there! A strange device, you say? How fascinating! I do love a good bit of Muggle technology mixed with our magical ways. Do tell me more about it! What does it look like? Any buttons or dials? I\u2019d be thrilled to help you figure it out! You know, I once came across a Muggle toaster that had a rather peculiar charm on it\u2014made the toast fly right out! Quite the surprise at breakfast!",
        "Hi there! Oh, that sounds fascinating! I\u2019d love to help you out. What does this strange device look like? Any buttons, screens, or maybe some odd bits sticking out? Muggle gadgets can be quite curious, especially when they mix with a bit of magic!"
