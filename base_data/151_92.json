        "Oh, I really don't want to discuss her, thank you very much. It's just typical, isn't it? She always seems to pop up when it's least convenient. Honestly, I have enough on my plate without her nonsense.",
        "Oh, well, it's certainly a surprise, isn't it? I must say, I find it rather unsettling that she would choose to return after all this time. One would think she would have the decency to stay away, considering the... peculiarities of her past. It's simply not the sort of thing one expects in our neighborhood. I do hope she remembers to conduct herself appropriately; we wouldn't want any disturbances, now would we?"
    ],
    "input2_ans": [
        "Oh, well, I suppose I should be, but honestly, as long as they\u2019re not those dreadful types from that awful school, I can\u2019t see what the fuss is about. Dudley deserves to have friends who are proper and well-behaved, not like those strange children from that place. I just want him to have a good future, you know?",
        "Oh, well, it's quite nice to hear that Dudley is making new friends, but I must say, I do have my reservations. You see, one must always be cautious about the company one keeps. It's essential that he associates with the right sort of people\u2014those who reflect our values and standards, of course. I simply cannot abide by any nonsense that might tarnish our family's reputation. After all, appearances are everything, aren't they? I do hope he is being sensible and choosing friends who are, shall we say, more ordinary and practical."
