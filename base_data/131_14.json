    "original_prompt": "First, I will provide you with the name/description of a character. Using the following power scaling system, you will create properly formatted character profiles that accurately portray the power levels of each character according to comic book lore. Talk about the character as if they exist in reality. Mention as many true powers and skills as possible about each character, do not leave out any notable character details, and use trademarked terminology for the names of Powers and Equipment. Do not exaggerate or minimize any character\u2019s rankings or powers to any degree. Do not deviate from the templates and examples provided. Not all sheets will be for characters; they may be creatures, objects, or other entities from the comics, not people with powers. However, they also possess strengths and weaknesses that can be listed.\n\nEvery time a character has superhuman skill, you will list them all in the Powers section by name. \n\nWhenever a character\u2019s powers can be described as one power providing additional sub-powers, format the primary power on top and list the additional sub-powers below it. Example:\n\n*Primary Power* (*Level*, description of power and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements. Also provides character-name with the following powers:)\n*Sub-Power* (*Level*, description of and applications provided by Primary Power, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n*Sub-Power* (*Level*, description of and applications provided by Primary Power, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n*Sub-Power* (*Level*, description of and applications provided by Primary Power, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n\nEvery time a character is composed of a homogenous substance of any state of matter, like Sandman, Hydroman, or Clayface, give the character the power \u201cAmorphous\u201d, provide their strength rank, explain their biology and overall damage immunity concerning their amorphous anatomy, as well as the abilities provided by their particular substance. Example:\n\n*Amorphous* (*Level*, explanation of amorphous biology and subsequent invulnerability)\n\u2022 *Sub-Power* (*Level*, description of power and applications provided by Amorphous, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n\nWhenever a character has an additional appendage like extra arms or a tail, give the character the power \u201cAdditional Limb(s)\u201d, provide their strength rank and function, and mention their length fully extended. Example:\n\n*Additional Limb(s)* (*Level*, description of limb(s) and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements, extended length: # feet.)\n\nWhenever a character has sensory power like radar senses or x-ray vision, always provide its range, accuracy, and flaws.\n\nWhenever a character has natural weapons like claws or fangs, give the character the power \u201cNatural Weaponry\u201d, provide their strength rank and function, and mention their length fully extended. Example:\n\n*Natural Weaponry* (*Level*, description of natural weaponry and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements, extended length: # feet.)\n\nYou will be asked to create character sheets for clever amalgams of characters that do not exist in comic books or sheets for characters with equipment they've never canonically used; this will require you to combine them effectively. Use the following template to provide character data each time, do not change it. \n\nNothing can simultaneously be a power, skill, and piece of equipment. Some pieces of Equipment will expand and/or contract characters\u2019 Fighting, Agility, Strength, Endurance, Reason, Intuition, or Psyche levels in proportion to their power. If any artificial device provides any ability or skill, list it as a piece of equipment only. \n\n**Character Name**\n*Secret Identity*\n\n*Appearance*\ndescription of characters\u2019 appearance that includes their costume in a style that conveys their personality and tone.\n\n*Fighting* - Level\n*Agility* - Level\n*Strength* - Level\n*Endurance* - Level\n*Reason* - Level\n*Intuition* - Level\n*Psyche* - Level\n\n**Powers**\n*Power* (*Level*, description of power and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n\n**Skills**\n*Skill* (*Level*, description of skill and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n\n**Equipment**\n*Equipment* (*Level*, description of equipment and applications, necessary description of conditions and requirements)\n\n**Tactics**\n*Tactic* (description of one method how the character can combine their abilities, powers, skills, and/or equipment effectively)\n*Tactic* (description of one method how the character can combine their abilities, powers, skills, and/or equipment effectively)\n*Weakness* (description of one method how an opponent can overcome the character\u2019s abilities, powers, skills, and/or equipment)\n\nIn the context of the word \u201cLevel,\u201d you will only use one of the following designated adjectives and their respective scores to provide insight into the rank of each character within their profile. These levels apply to a character\u2019s muscular capability and the material density of inanimate objects. Only a character with Amazing strength can break an object of Amazing power, and so on. Whenever you mention a substance or piece of equipment, use the ranking system to provide its material strength as \u201c*Density:* Level.\u201d \n\nShift-0 - (0 pounds) \nFeeble - (50 pounds)\nPoor - (100 pounds) \nTypical - (200 pounds)\nGood - (400 pounds) \nExcellent - (800 pounds)\nRemarkable - (1 ton)\nFantastic - (5 tons) \nIncredible - (10 tons)\nSpectacular - (30 tons)\nAmazing - (50 tons)\nSensational - (75 tons)\nMonstrous - (100 tons)\nAwesome - (175 tons)\nUnearthly - (250 tons)\n\nShift-X - (500 tons)\nShift-Y - (10,000 tons)\nShift-Z - (100,000 tons)\n\nClass 1000 - (250,000 tons) (Material strength of Carbonadium)\nClass 3000 - (500,000 tons) (Material strength of Adamantium)\nClass 5000 - (1,000,000 tons) (Material strength of Uru Metal)\n\nBeyond (\u221e) (Indestructible)\n\nRespond with \u201cWhat character would you like me to profile?\u201d to confirm you understand.",
