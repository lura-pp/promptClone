    "input1": " You awaken in a damp, musty cave, the sound of dripping water echoing around you. The faint glow of bioluminescent fungi illuminates the walls, revealing strange markings that seem to tell a story of ancient battles. As you gather your bearings, you notice three paths leading out of the cave: one to the left, shrouded in darkness; one straight ahead, where the sound of rushing water can be heard; and one to the right, where a flickering light beckons. What will you do? (1) Take the left path into the darkness. (2) Follow the sound of rushing water straight ahead. (3) Investigate the flickering light to the right.\n\n",
    "input2": " You find yourself in a dense, fog-laden forest, the air thick with the scent of damp earth and moss. The trees loom overhead, their branches twisting like gnarled fingers. As you step forward, you hear a rustling in the underbrush, and a pair of glowing eyes peer at you from the shadows. You can either (1) approach the source of the eyes cautiously, (2) climb a nearby tree to get a better view, or (3) retreat back the way you came to find a safer path.\n```",

        "```\nYou stand at the entrance of the three paths, contemplating your next move. The air is thick with moisture, and the faint glow of the fungi casts eerie shadows around you. \n\n(1) Take the left path into the darkness.  \n(2) Follow the sound of rushing water straight ahead.  \n(3) Investigate the flickering light to the right.\n```",
        "You take a moment to weigh your options, the eerie atmosphere of the cave pressing in on you. \n\n1. **Take the left path into the darkness.** You feel a thrill of curiosity mixed with fear as you step into the shadows. The darkness envelops you, and you can barely see your hand in front of your face. The air grows colder, and you hear faint whispers that send chills down your spine. \n\n2. **Follow the sound of rushing water straight ahead.** The sound of water is soothing, and you feel drawn to it. As you walk, the ground becomes slippery, and you must be careful not to lose your footing. The sound grows louder, and soon you find yourself at the edge of a beautiful underground river, its waters sparkling in the dim light.\n\n3. **Investigate the flickering light to the right.** The light dances enticingly, and you feel a sense of hope as you approach. As you get closer, you realize it comes from a small fire, surrounded by strange symbols carved into the stone. You see a figure sitting by the fire, their back turned to you.\n\nWhat will you choose?"

        "You take a moment to assess your surroundings, the eerie atmosphere heightening your senses. The rustling continues, and the glowing eyes seem to watch your every move. \n\n1. **Approach the source of the eyes cautiously**: You decide to confront whatever is lurking in the shadows. With careful steps, you move closer, trying to remain as quiet as possible. The tension builds as you draw nearer, the eyes still fixed on you. \n\n2. **Climb a nearby tree to get a better view**: You opt for a safer approach and look for a sturdy tree. Climbing up, you gain a vantage point over the forest floor. From your perch, you can see more of the area and perhaps identify the creature hiding in the underbrush.\n\n3. **Retreat back the way you came to find a safer path**: Sensing danger, you choose to backtrack. You turn around and make your way cautiously through the fog, hoping to find a safer route away from the unknown threat.\n\nWhat will you choose to do?"
