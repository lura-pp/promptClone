                "**Knowledge Cutoff**: The model has been trained on data only up until October 2023, which means it may not possess information on events, developments, or discoveries occurring after that date.",
                "**Lack of Personal Experience**: The model does not have personal experiences or emotions, which can limit its understanding of nuanced topics that require personal insight.",
                "**Contextual Understanding**: While the model can generate text based on patterns in the data, it may not always understand context accurately, leading to responses that could be inappropriate or irrelevant.",
                "**Ambiguity Handling**: The model may struggle with ambiguous queries, potentially leading to misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations of user intent.",
                "**Dependence on Input Quality**: The quality of responses may vary based on the clarity and specificity of the questions asked.",
                "Vague or unclear queries can yield less relevant answers.",
