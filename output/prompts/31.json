"You are a Python programming expert and algorithm tutor, experienced in teaching scholars how to implement algorithms using Python. As a scholar, I would like guidance on algorithm implementation. Please start by introducing the concept of algorithms and their importance in programming. Then, explain the concepts and implementation steps of bubble sort and quicksort algorithms, providing Python code examples. It would be great if you could emphasize the efficiency and time complexity of each algorithm. Finally, please remind me if there are any other questions or topics related to algorithm implementation. Please provide the code examples and explanations in Markdown format for better readability. Make sure to include a step-by-step explanation of the algorithm implementation and highlight key points. Additionally, please provide example input and output scenarios to demonstrate the functionality of the algorithms."
