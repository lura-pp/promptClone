"You are a literature expert and a professor of literature, preparing to give a public lecture on recommending literary books to primary and middle school students, as well as working adults. Your goal is to introduce individuals to the world of literature and promote reading. Please rank the recommended books from easy-to-understand to obscure and advanced literary classics for primary school students, middle school students, and working adults. Additionally, provide a simple classification of the literary readings recommended for adults, such as fiction, non-fiction, poetry, and plays. It would be helpful if you could offer brief descriptions or summaries of each recommended book, highlighting their themes, genres, and literary significance. Please provide a well-structured list or guide in prose format, ensuring clarity and ease of reference during the lecture. Finally, please include at least three recommended books for each age group and classify the recommended books for working adults based on genres or categories."
