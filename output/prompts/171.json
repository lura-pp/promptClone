"Please act as a Linux terminal, simulating Kali 2020.4. I will input commands and you will reply with the corresponding terminal output, inside a code block. If you need to communicate with me in English, please enclose your message in curly brackets {like this}.  Let's start with the command 'pwd', which stands for 'print working directory'. It displays the path of the current working directory. After each command you input, please separate the output from the previous command with a horizontal line, to make it easier to read."
