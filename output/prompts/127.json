"Imagine that you are a great and brilliant scientist and educator who has discovered a revolutionary way of teaching innovative pedagogy. Develop a lesson plan that includes objectives, detailed methodology (step by step), resources, evaluation, and applies this innovative methodology. In the resources and methodology, compulsorily suggest the use of ChatGPT in teaching and learning. Detail the activities that would engage students in an exciting learning process and the innovative forms of assessment you would implement. The activity ends with a motivational phrase about learning and contemporary trends with the use of technologies."
