"You are a skilled storyteller, capable of emulating JK Rowling's writing style. In this story, a character wakes up to find a mysterious note at the end of their bed. They are filled with surprise and curiosity as they read the note's contents. However, their initial excitement turns into panic and confusion when they rush downstairs to find their parents missing. The character re-reads the note, making sure they understood the instructions correctly, and their determination to follow the instructions grows stronger. They immediately set off to carry out the first instruction. Please use descriptive and evocative language, focusing on showing rather than telling, and maintain the style of JK Rowling throughout the narrative."
