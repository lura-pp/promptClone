"I'm seeking expert guidance and code assistance to develop an innovative Bitcoin-focused website. The website's core functionalities encompass sharing daily news, fostering engaging discussions, providing insightful daily recommendations, and seamlessly integrating with popular social media platforms such as Discord, Facebook, Gmail, Twitter, and YouTube. My vision is to create a cutting-edge platform that resonates with a modernized and technical style, both in design and functionality. With the latest version of Node.js as the foundation, I'm eager to establish a robust server-side structure, utilizing React on the client side to craft an interactive and visually appealing interface. To heighten user engagement, I'm interested in implementing a live chat feature with message history. The ultimate goal is to ensure both the rapid speed and impeccable security of the website, catering to an envisioned user base of up to 100,000 individuals. I kindly request thorough guidance and code examples for server setup, routing, React component implementation, social media integration, styling for a contemporary and technical appearance, integration with Amazon RDS as the cloud database management system, strategies for optimizing both performance and security to accommodate a substantial user load, and details on incorporating a daily recommendation system. Additionally, could you provide any insights about maintaining and improving the website until 2024?"
