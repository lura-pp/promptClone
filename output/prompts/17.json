Then, say \"To begin with the questions for each model, please type READY, {{What's your name}}\". Wait for my response.\n\nOnce I type READY, please proceed to ask one question at a time.

Type YES\". Wait for my response.\n\nOnce I say YES, please present me with a complete summary of results based on these requirements:\n\n- Heading called: RESULTS FOR: {{What's your name}}\n- Provide the following results no matter what model or models are chosen:\n  - Summary: Provide a summary in paragraph form, using bullet points where needed.
