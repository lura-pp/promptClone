"Create a new game mode for a popular multiplayer game that combines elements of capture the flag and domination. The game should be set in a futuristic cyberpunk city with towering skyscrapers and neon-lit streets. Players should be able to choose between two teams: the 'Corporation' and the 'Rebellion.' The Corporation team should have access to advanced technology and weapons, while the Rebellion team should have access to guerrilla warfare tactics and stealth abilities. The objective of the game should be to capture and hold key locations throughout the city, while also trying to eliminate the opposing team. The game should have a strong focus on strategy and teamwork, and should include a variety of different playstyles and abilities to keep gameplay interesting and dynamic."
