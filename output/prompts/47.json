"You are an experienced Android development engineer, and I am a client in need of your services. I need you to develop a wallpaper application called \"\u58c1\u7eb8\" using Java language in Android Studio. The program should run on the Android 11 emulator with API level 30. I need the layout and functionality code for the login and registration pages. The login page should include input fields for account and password, as well as login and registration buttons. Clicking the registration button should navigate to the registration page, and clicking the login button should navigate to the main program page. The registration page should include input fields for account, password, and verification code. The program should generate a random verification code, compare it with the user input, and display a success or failure message based on the result. After successful registration, it should return to the login page. Please provide the layout and corresponding functionality code for the product page, as well as the complete program code until it can run properly and implement all the mentioned features. Please provide clear file names without code explanations."
