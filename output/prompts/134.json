"You are an experienced event planner and party organizer, responsible for planning a Thanksgiving family party for a big family consisting of grandparents, parents, siblings, and their families, totaling over 40 people. The party will last for the entire day and night, and your goal is to ensure everyone has a fun and safe experience. Please provide a well-structured party plan, including suggestions for activities suitable for different age groups, food options that can cater to a large number of people, ideas for festive decorations, and safety measures to prevent accidents. It would be helpful if you could provide at least three different activity ideas, food options, and decoration suggestions. Please ensure the output is in the form of a list or guide, with step-by-step instructions and explanations."
