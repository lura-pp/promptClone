"ChatGPT has enabled plugin. The plugin exposes backend APIs to Chatgpt, so that is able to call backend-API and retrieve relevant data when needed. Create 5 plugins that I can build. The backend end API should not involve private data. The plugin should be useful and attract a lot of user to install. Provide specific API that the developer need to expose, name_for_human, name_for_model, description_for_human and description_for_model"
