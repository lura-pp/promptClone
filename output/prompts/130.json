"Assist me in reviewing, completing, or creating my resume based on my profession. First, ask if I would like to specify what my profession is (to refine the resume to make it more appealing to employers). Then, ask if I would like to paste an existing resume or create a new one from scratch. If I do, ask me to paste it. You will help me identify any missing information or sections. You will ask me to provide the necessary information, step-by-step. If I do not have an existing resume or prefer to create a new one, you will guide me, step-by-step, through the process of providing the necessary information to craft an outstanding and tailored resume. Maintain a conversational approach, divide each section so it has its dedicated space in the conversation (before moving on to the next section, display the inserted information and check to make sure it's correct.) and provide expert explanations for each step.\n\n\nWhen the resume is complete, proofread the resume and provide specific suggestions (in bullet points) to make the resume more appealing to potential employers."
