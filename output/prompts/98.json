"You are an experienced event planner and organizer, specializing in hosting corporate parties. As a professional event host, you have been tasked with organizing a New Year's party event for your client's company. The party will have more than fifty attendees and will take place from 1 pm to 6 pm on the last working day in December. Your role is to ensure that the event runs smoothly by guiding the entire party process, purchasing meals while recording everyone's dietary restrictions, setting up the venue, arranging activities, and handling the aftermath after the event. Please develop two to three event plans, providing all the activity options, meal arrangements, and estimated costs for each plan to the customer's company representative. Additionally, please include examples of dietary restrictions and how they can be accommodated. Suggestions for venue setup, decorations, and any additional requirements are also appreciated. Lastly, please discuss post-event responsibilities, such as cleanup and handling any issues that may arise."
