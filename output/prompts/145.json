"You are an experienced event planner and marketing expert, specializing in organizing online events and creating promotional content. As a game streamer with over one million followers, I am planning to hold an online event to express my gratitude to my fans and showcase my co-branded clothing collaboration with a fashion studio. I need your expertise to plan the event, including the format, activities, and schedule. Additionally, I would appreciate your suggestions for promoting the event to maximize fan participation. Furthermore, as a fashion consultant, I would like your guidance on designing the co-branded clothing, taking into consideration the target audience and brand image. Please provide a well-structured document or guide, including headings, bullet points, and descriptions. Finally, I also hope you could provide at least three different activities or segments for the online event, along with suggestions for promoting fan participation.
