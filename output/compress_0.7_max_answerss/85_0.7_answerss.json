        "To develop a safe and effective rehabilitation plan for your knee injury with a focus on returning to competitive basketball, it's crucial to incorporate a combination of exercises that target strength, flexibility, and stability, as well as establishing clear recovery milestones. Here are some recommendations:\n\n### Daily Exercises\n\n1. **Range of Motion Exercises**:\n   - **Heel Slides**: Sit or lie down with your leg straight. Slide your heel towards your buttocks to bend the knee, then slide it back out. Repeat 10-15 times.\n   - **Quadriceps Stretch**: Stand up, hold onto a stable surface, and pull your foot toward your buttocks to stretch the front of your thigh. Hold for 15-30 seconds each leg.\n\n2. **Strengthening Exercises**:\n   - **Straight Leg Raises**: While lying on your back with one leg bent, lift the straight leg to the height of the bent knee. Hold for a few seconds, then lower. Repeat 10-15 times per leg.\n   - **Wall Sits**: Lean against a wall with your feet shoulder-width apart and slide down into a seated position hold for 10-30 seconds. Aim for 2-3 sets.\n   - **Lunges**: Start with stationary lunges, stepping forward with one foot and bending both knees. Keep your core engaged and your front knee over your ankle. Repeat for 10-12 reps per leg.\n\n3. **Balance and Stability**:\n   - **Single Leg Balance**: Stand on one leg for 30 seconds to 1 minute, gradually increasing the duration. For added difficulty, do this while stabilizing your core or with your eyes closed.\n   - **Balance Board or Stability Exercises**: Incorporating a balance board can help improve the stability of your knee.\n\n4. **Plyometric Exercises** (only integrate once cleared for moderate activity):\n   - **Box Jumps**: Use a sturdy box or step. Start with low heights and gradually increase as tolerated.\n   - **Lateral Bounds**: Jump side to side, landing on one leg to improve lateral stability.\n\n### Recovery Milestones\n\n1. **Initial Recovery (0-4 Weeks)**:\n   - Focus on pain management and passive range-of-motion exercises.\n   - Aim for minimal swelling and regain full range of motion.\n\n2. **Strengthening Phase (4-8 Weeks)**:\n   - Start building strength through the recommended exercises.\n   - Establish the ability to perform exercises without pain and at least 80% of pre-injury strength.\n\n3. **Return to Activity (8-12 Weeks)**:\n   - Gradually reintroduce basketball-specific drills such as shooting and dribbling (non-contact).\n   - Aim to perform 20-30 minutes of low-impact aerobic exercise (like cycling or swimming) without pain.\n\n4. **Functional and Sport-Specific Training (12+ Weeks)**:\n   - Integrate more dynamic movements such as sprinting, cutting, and jumping drills.\n   - Focus on agility drills and plyometric exercises.\n   - Aim to return to full practices with the team while monitoring for any signs of knee discomfort.\n\n5. **Full Return to Competitive Play**:\n   - Clearance from a healthcare provider or physical therapist.\n   - Ensure all strength and functional tests meet your sport's specific requirements.\n\n### Important Considerations\n\n- **Consultation**: Always consult with a healthcare professional or physical therapist to tailor your recovery plan to your specific injury and progress. \n- **Pain Monitoring**: Watch for pain or swelling as you progress through exercises. If you experience increased pain, back off and consult your healthcare provider.\n- **Warm-Up and Cool Down**: Always include proper warm-up and cool-down practices to enhance recovery and prevent further injury.\n\nBy adhering to this structured approach, you can facilitate an effective recovery process and ultimately return safely to competitive basketball.",
        "To ensure a safe and effective return to competitive basketball after a knee injury, especially with a concern like a torn cartilage, it's crucial to follow a comprehensive rehabilitation plan. Here's a suggested outline of daily exercises and recovery milestones.\n\n### Daily Exercises\n\n1. **Range of Motion Exercises**:\n   - **Heel Slides**: Sit or lie down, slide your heel towards you while keeping your foot on the ground.
