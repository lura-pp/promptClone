        "To effectively express a complex idea in a prompt that I can understand and respond to accurately, consider following these key steps:\n\n1. **Be Clear and Specific**: Clearly define the main idea or concept you wish to discuss. Avoid vague language or broad statements. For example, instead of saying \"Tell me about technology,\" specify \"Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on job markets.\"\n\n2. **Break It Down**: If your idea has multiple components, break them down into smaller parts. You can ask separate questions or outline different aspects you want to address. For instance, you might ask about the benefits of a technology first, followed by its challenges.\n\n3. **Provide Context**: Include any relevant background information or context that might help clarify your idea. This could be information about the audience for which the idea is intended, existing knowledge on the topic, or any assumptions that should be considered.\n\n4. **State Your Purpose**: Clearly articulate what you want to achieve or learn from the conversation. Are you seeking an explanation, brainstorming ideas, or looking for solutions? This will help me tailor my response to meet your objectives.\n\n5. **Use Examples**: If applicable, provide examples to illustrate your idea. Examples can make complex concepts more relatable and easier to understand. For instance, if discussing a theoretical concept, reference a real-world application.\n\n6. **Ask Open-Ended Questions**: Formulate your prompt in a way that encourages discussion. Open-ended questions often lead to more comprehensive and detailed responses than yes/no questions.\n\n7. **Iterate if Necessary**: If the initial response does not capture your idea accurately, feel free to provide feedback or additional details.
