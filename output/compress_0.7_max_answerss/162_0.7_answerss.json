        "Sure! Here's an example of a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a number. I've included comments to help explain the code:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a non-negative integer n.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for.\n\n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if the input number is negative\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result variable to hold the factorial value\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Loop through numbers from 1 to n\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= i  # Multiply result by current number i\n    \n    return result  # Return the final factorial value\n```\n\n### Comments Breakdown:\n- The function `factorial(n)` takes one argument `n`, which is a non-negative integer.\n- The docstring provides a clear explanation of the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n- An error check is performed to raise a `ValueError` if the input number is negative, as factorials are undefined for negative integers.\n- A `result` variable is initialized to 1, which will be used to store the ongoing product.\n- A `for` loop iterates through all numbers from 1 to `n`, multiplying them together to compute the factorial.\n- Finally, the computed factorial is returned.\n\nFeel free to ask if you need more details or modifications!",
        "Sure! Please provide the code snippet you'd like me to review, and I'll add comments to help explain its functionality and improve clarity.",
        "Absolutely! Here\u2019s a simple Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number, along with comments:\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given non-negative integer n.\n    \n    Parameters:\n    n (int): A non-negative integer for which the factorial is to be computed.\n    \n    Returns:\n    int: The factorial of the number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    \n    # Check if the input is a negative number\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers.\")\n    \n    # Initialize the result to 1 (as the factorial of 0 is 1)\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Loop to calculate factorial\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= i  # Multiply result by the current number i\n    \n    return result  # Return the computed factorial\n\n# Example usage\nnumber = 5\nprint(f\"The factorial of {number} is {factorial(number)}.\")\n```\n\n### Comments Explained:\n1. **Function Docstring**: Describes what the function does, its parameters, and the return value.\n2. **Input Validation**: Checks if the number is negative and raises an exception if it is, ensuring that factorials are only calculated for non-negative integers.\n3. **Initialization**: Starts the result at 1 (this is necessary since we will be multiplying).\n4. **Loop**: Iterates through numbers from 1 to `n`, multiplying them to get the factorial.\n5. **Return Statement**: Returns the final computed factorial value.\n   \nFeel free to review it and let me know if you have any questions or need further comments!"
