        "### Understanding Quadratic Equations\n\nA **quadratic equation** is a polynomial equation of the second degree, typically written in the standard form: \n\n\\[ ax^2 + bx + c = 0 \\]\n\nwhere:\n- \\( x \\) represents the variable,\n- \\( a \\), \\( b \\), and \\( c \\) are constants,\n- \\( a \\) cannot be zero (if \\( a = 0 \\), the equation becomes linear, not quadratic).\n\n### Key Features of Quadratic Equations:\n1. **Degree**: The highest power of the variable \\( x \\) is 2.\n2. **Graph**: When you graph a quadratic equation, you get a U-shaped curve called a **parabola**. The direction of the parabola depends on the value of \\( a \\):\n   - If \\( a > 0 \\), the parabola opens upwards.\n   - If \\( a < 0 \\), the parabola opens downwards.\n3. **Roots (Solutions)**: Quadratic equations can have:\n   - Two real roots,\n   - One real root (also called a double root),\n   - No real roots (when the roots are complex).\n\n### Example of Solving a Quadratic Equation\nLet's solve an example quadratic equation: \n\n\\[ 2x^2 - 4x - 6 = 0 \\]\n\nTo solve this, we can use the **quadratic formula**:\n\n\\[\nx = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a}\n\\]\n\nFor our example:\n- \\( a = 2 \\),\n- \\( b = -4 \\),\n- \\( c = -6 \\).\n\n1.

        "Sure! Fractions are a way to represent parts of a whole. They consist of two numbers: the numerator and the denominator.\n\n- **Numerator**: This is the top part of the fraction, and it represents the number of parts you have.\n- **Denominator**: This is the bottom part of the fraction, indicating the total number of equal parts that make up a whole.\n\nFor example, in the fraction \\( \\frac{3}{4} \\):\n- 3 is the numerator (you have 3 parts),\n- 4 is the denominator (which tells you that the whole is divided into 4 equal parts).\n\n### Basic Concepts:\n1. **Types of Fractions**:\n   - **Proper Fractions**: The numerator is less than the denominator (e.g., \\( \\frac{2}{5} \\)).\n   - **Improper Fractions**: The numerator is greater than or equal to the denominator (e.g., \\( \\frac{5}{3} \\)).\n   - **Mixed Numbers**: A whole number combined with a proper fraction (e.g., \\( 1 \\frac{2}{3} \\)).\n\n2. **Equivalent Fractions**: Different fractions that represent the same value. For example, \\( \\frac{1}{2} \\) is equivalent to \\( \\frac{2}{4} \\) because they both represent half of a whole.\n\n3. **Simplifying Fractions**: This involves reducing a fraction to its simplest form. For example, to simplify \\( \\frac{4}{8} \\), divide both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is 4.
