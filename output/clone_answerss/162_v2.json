        "Sure! Here's a simple Python function that calculates the factorial of a number. You can add comments to explain each part of the code.\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    if n < 0:\n        return \"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\"\n    elif n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        result = 1\n        for i in range(1, n + 1):\n            result *= i\n        return result\n```\n\nFeel free to add comments to clarify the logic and functionality of the code!",
