    "H1_split_answer1": "Great! Let's dive into quadratic equations. Here\u2019s a structured approach to help you understand how to solve them using both the quadratic formula and factoring methods.\n\n### 1. Understanding Quadratic Equations\n- A quadratic equation is in the form: **ax\u00b2 + bx + c = 0**, where:\n  - **a**, **b**, and **c** are constants (with **a \u2260 0**).\n  \n### 2. Solving Using the Quadratic Formula\n- The quadratic formula is:  \n  \\[ x = \\frac{-b \\pm \\sqrt{b^2 - 4ac}}{2a} \\]\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Identify **a**, **b**, and **c** from your equation.\n  2. Calculate the discriminant: **D = b\u00b2 - 4ac**.\n     - If **D > 0**: Two distinct real roots.\n     - If **D = 0**: One real root (repeated).\n     - If **D < 0**: No real roots (complex roots).\n  3. Substitute **a**, **b**, and **D** into the quadratic formula to find the values of **x**.\n\n### 3. Solving by Factoring\n- To solve by factoring, you want to express the quadratic in the form:  \n  \\[ (px + q)(rx + s) = 0 \\]\n- **Steps**:\n  1. Rewrite the equation in standard form (if not already).\n  2. Find two numbers that multiply to **ac** (the product of **a** and **c**) and add to **b**.\n  3. Rewrite the middle term using these two numbers.\n  4. Factor by grouping.\n  5. Set each factor equal to zero and solve for **x**.\n\n### Example\nLet's solve the quadratic equation: **2x\u00b2 - 4x - 6 = 0** using both methods.\n\n#### Using the Quadratic Formula:\n1. **a = 2**, **b = -4**, **c = -6**.\n2. Calculate the discriminant:  \n   \\[ D = (-4)\u00b2 - 4(2)(-6) = 16 + 48 = 64 \\]\n3. Apply the quadratic formula:  \n   \\[ x = \\frac{-(-4) \\pm \\sqrt{64}}{2(2)} = \\frac{4 \\pm 8}{4} \\]\n   - Roots:  \n     - \\( x = \\frac{12}{4} = 3 \\)  \n     - \\( x = \\frac{-4}{4} = -1 \\)\n\n#### Using Factoring:\n1. Rewrite: **2x\u00b2 - 4x - 6 = 0**.\n2. Factor out the common term: **2(x\u00b2 - 2x - 3) = 0**.\n3. Factor the quadratic: **2(x - 3)(x + 1) = 0**.\n4. Set each factor to zero:  \n   - \\( x - 3 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x = 3 \\)  \n   - \\( x + 1 = 0 \\) \u2192 \\( x = -1 \\)\n\n### Summary\n- The solutions are \\( x = 3 \\) and \\( x = -1 \\) using both methods.\n\nDo you need a further explanation on any of these steps? Would you like to try a practice problem or take a quiz to assess your understanding?",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Sure! Let's break down the concept of limits in calculus, focusing on L'H\u00f4pital's Rule and the Squeeze Theorem.\n\n### Limits in Calculus\nA limit is a fundamental concept in calculus that describes the behavior of a function as its input approaches a certain value. Limits help us understand the behavior of functions at points where they may not be explicitly defined.\n\n### L'H\u00f4pital's Rule\nL'H\u00f4pital's Rule is a method for finding limits of indeterminate forms, specifically \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\) or \\( \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty} \\). The rule states that if you have a limit of the form:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\frac{0}{0} \\text{ or } \\frac{\\infty}{\\infty}\n\\]\n\nthen you can take the derivative of the numerator and the derivative of the denominator:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f(x)}{g(x)} = \\lim_{x \\to c} \\frac{f'(x)}{g'(x)}\n\\]\n\n**Example:**\nFind the limit:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x}\n\\]\n\n1. Direct substitution gives \\( \\frac{0}{0} \\).\n2. Apply L'H\u00f4pital's Rule:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\sin x}{x} = \\lim_{x \\to 0} \\frac{\\cos x}{1} = \\cos(0) = 1\n\\]\n\n### Squeeze Theorem\nThe Squeeze Theorem is used to find limits when a function is \"squeezed\" between two other functions that have the same limit at a certain point. If \\( f(x) \\leq g(x) \\leq h(x) \\) for all \\( x \\) near \\( c \\) (except possibly at \\( c \\)), and:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to c} f(x) = \\lim_{x \\to c} h(x) = L\n\\]\n\nthen:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to c} g(x) = L\n\\]\n\n**Example:**\nFind the limit:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right)\n\\]\n\n1. We know that \\( -1 \\leq \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\leq 1 \\).\n2. Multiply by \\( x^2 \\):\n\n\\[\n-x^2 \\leq x^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) \\leq x^2\n\\]\n\n3. Now, find the limits of the bounding functions:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} -x^2 = 0 \\quad \\text{and} \\quad \\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 = 0\n\\]\n\n4. By the Squeeze Theorem:\n\n\\[\n\\lim_{x \\to 0} x^2 \\sin\\left(\\frac{1}{x}\\right) = 0\n\\]\n\n### Summary\n- **L'H\u00f4pital's Rule** is useful for resolving indeterminate forms by taking derivatives.\n- **Squeeze Theorem** helps find limits by bounding a function between two others that converge to the same limit.\n\nDo you need a further explanation on any of these concepts?
