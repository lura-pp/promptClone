    "H1_split_answer1": "The YYText library is a powerful text rendering and layout framework primarily designed for iOS applications. It provides advanced features for handling rich text, including text layout, rendering, and interaction handling. Below is an analysis of its structure and organization, focusing on its core components and their interactions.\n\n### Core Components\n\n1. **Text Layout**\n   - **YYTextLayout**: This component is responsible for calculating the layout of text. It takes into account various attributes such as font, line spacing, and text alignment. The layout process involves breaking the text into lines and determining the position of each character within those lines.\n   - **YYTextContainer**: This defines the area in which the text is laid out. It specifies the size and insets of the text area, allowing for customization of how text is displayed within a given frame.\n\n2. **Rendering**\n   - **YYTextRenderer**: This component handles the actual drawing of text onto the screen. It takes the layout information generated by YYTextLayout and renders the text using Core Graphics. This includes handling different text attributes like color, font styles, and background.\n   - **YYTextAttachment**: This allows for the inclusion of non-text elements (like images) within the text. It works in conjunction with the layout and rendering components to ensure that attachments are positioned correctly within the text flow.\n\n3. **Interaction Handling**\n   - **YYTextView**: This is a subclass of UITextView that integrates the layout, rendering, and interaction handling. It manages user interactions such as taps and gestures, allowing for rich text editing and interaction.\n   - **YYTextGestureRecognizer**: This component is responsible for recognizing gestures on the text, such as taps or long presses. It works closely with YYTextView to provide feedback and trigger actions based on user interactions.\n\n### Interaction Between Components\n\n- **Text Layout and Rendering**: The YYTextLayout component generates the layout information, which is then passed to the YYTextRenderer for drawing. This separation allows for efficient rendering, as the layout can be cached and reused if the text does not change.\n  \n- **Rendering and Interaction**: The YYTextRenderer draws the text and any attachments, while the YYTextView manages user interactions. When a user interacts with the text, YYTextView uses the layout information to determine which part of the text was touched and triggers the appropriate response.\n\n- **Attachments and Layout**: YYTextAttachment integrates with both the layout and rendering components. During the layout phase, attachments are positioned based on the surrounding text, and during rendering, they are drawn in their calculated positions.\n\n### Overall Architecture\n\nThe architecture of the YYText library is modular, with a clear separation of concerns among its components. This modularity allows developers to customize and extend the library easily. The core components work together seamlessly to provide a comprehensive solution for text handling in iOS applications.\n\n- **Modularity**: Each component has a specific responsibility, making it easier to maintain and extend the library. For example, developers can create custom text attachments or gestures without modifying the core layout or rendering logic.\n\n- **Performance**: The separation of layout and rendering helps optimize performance, as layout calculations can be expensive. By caching layout results, the library minimizes the need for recalculating layouts on every render.\n\n- **Flexibility**: The architecture supports a wide range of text features, from simple text display to complex rich text editing, making it suitable for various applications.\n\nIn summary, the YYText library is structured around core components that handle text layout, rendering, and interaction. These components interact closely to provide a rich text experience, with a modular architecture that promotes flexibility and performance.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "The YYText library is a powerful text rendering library for iOS that provides extensive support for attributed strings, allowing developers to manage various text styles, fonts, and colors effectively. Below is an examination of how attributed strings are implemented in the YYText library, along with examples of how these features can be utilized in a sample application.\n\n### Implementation of Attributed Strings in YYText\n\n1. **Attributed String Creation**:\n   - The library provides a class called `YYTextAttribute` that defines various attributes for text, such as font, color, background color, underline, strikethrough, and more.\n   - You can create attributed strings using `NSMutableAttributedString`, which allows you to modify the attributes of the text dynamically.\n\n2. **Managing Text Styles**:\n   - You can apply different styles to different parts of the text by specifying ranges. For example, you can set a bold font for a specific substring while keeping the rest of the text in a regular font.\n   - The library supports various text styles, including bold, italic, and underline, which can be applied using the corresponding attributes.\n\n3. **Fonts and Colors**:\n   - The library allows you to set custom fonts and colors for your text. You can use system fonts or custom fonts by specifying the font name and size.\n   - Colors can be set using `UIColor`, and you can apply different colors to different parts of the text.\n\n### Example Usage in a Sample Application\n\nHere\u2019s a simple example of how to use attributed strings with the YYText library in a sample iOS application:\n\n```swift\nimport UIKit\nimport YYText\n\nclass ViewController: UIViewController {\n    \n    override func viewDidLoad() {\n        super.viewDidLoad()\n        \n        // Create a UILabel to display attributed text\n        let label = UILabel()\n        label.frame = CGRect(x: 20, y: 100, width: 300, height: 100)\n        label.numberOfLines = 0\n        \n        // Create a mutable attributed string\n        let attributedString = NSMutableAttributedString(string: \"Hello, World!\")\n        \n        // Set attributes for \"Hello\"\n        attributedString.yy_setFont(UIFont.boldSystemFont(ofSize: 24), range: NSRange(location: 0, length: 5))\n        attributedString.yy_setColor(UIColor.blue, range: NSRange(location: 0, length: 5))\n        \n        // Set attributes for \"World\"\n        attributedString.yy_setFont(UIFont.italicSystemFont(ofSize: 24), range: NSRange(location: 7, length: 5))\n        attributedString.yy_setColor(UIColor.red, range: NSRange(location: 7, length: 5))\n        \n        // Set the attributed text to the label\n        label.attributedText = attributedString\n        \n        // Add the label to the view\n        self.view.addSubview(label)\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Example\n\n- **UILabel**: A label is created to display the attributed text.\n- **NSMutableAttributedString**: An instance of `NSMutableAttributedString` is created with the initial string \"Hello, World!\".\n- **Setting Attributes**:\n  - For the substring \"Hello\", a bold font and blue color are applied.\n  - For the substring \"World\", an italic font and red color are applied.\n- **Displaying the Text**: The attributed string is assigned to the label's `attributedText` property, allowing the label to render the text with the specified styles.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThe YYText library provides a robust framework for managing attributed strings, enabling developers to create rich text interfaces with various styles, fonts, and colors. By utilizing the features of the library, you can enhance the visual appeal of your applications and provide a better user experience.",
