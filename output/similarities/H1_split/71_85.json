    "H1_split_answer1": "In the early stages of human civilization, people relied primarily on hunting and gathering for sustenance. They roamed vast landscapes in search of food, following animal trails and gathering edible plants. Their survival was closely tied to their understanding of the environment, insights into animal behavior, and ability to adapt to different climates. This way of life was filled with difficulties, requiring constant mobility and creativity, but it also showcased the ingenuity and resilience of our ancestors.",
