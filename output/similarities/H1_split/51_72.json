I am writing to formally express my dissatisfaction with a recent experience at your establishment that I believe warrants your immediate attention.\n\nDuring a crucial business meeting, I moved to one of the quieter rooms, unaware that an additional payment was required for its use. To my surprise, a staff member entered the room and, rather rudely, insisted that I leave not once, but three times, despite my polite request to settle the payment after my meeting concluded. \n\nWhen I finally exited, she confronted me in an extremely condescending manner, implying that I was ignoring her and questioning my financial ability to afford the room's rate of $95/hour. This encounter left me feeling deeply insulted and disrespected. \n\nI believe such behavior is unacceptable and should not be tolerated in your establishment. I urge you to take appropriate action against this staff member to ensure that no other customer has to endure a similar experience in the future.\n\nThank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to your prompt response.\n\nSincerely,  \n[Your Name]  \n[Your Contact Information]  \n[Your Position/Company, if applicable]  ",

A staff member entered the room and, in a passive-aggressive tone, demanded that I vacate the space not just once, but three separate times, despite my assurance that I would pay after my meeting.
