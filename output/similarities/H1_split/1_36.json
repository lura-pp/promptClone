    "H1_split_answer1": "As the moonlight casts an eerie glow over the Daughter's Village, Li Xiaoyao grips his sword tightly, feeling the weight of responsibility on his shoulders. The villagers, their eyes wide with fear, look to him for guidance. The ground shakes ominously as the first wave of Jiangshi emerges, their grotesque forms illuminated by the pale light. With a strength of 20, these undead creatures pose a significant threat, capable of draining the life energy of anyone they touch.\n\n**Current Resources:**\n- Spirit Stones: 15\n- Immortal Grass: 3\n- Defense Strength: 50 (initial)\n\n**Strategy:**\n\n1. **Assess the Terrain:**\n   - Li Xiaoyao scans the area for natural barriers and advantageous positions. The village is surrounded by dense trees that can be used to create ambush points. He decides to set up defenses near the Spring of Life, using the trees as cover.\n\n2. **Set Up Defenses:**\n   - **Traps:** With the spirit stones, he can create traps around the Spring. He allocates 5 spirit stones to set up spike traps that will injure the Jiangshi as they approach.\n   - **Barriers:** He uses another 5 spirit stones to create a magical barrier that will slow down the Jiangshi, giving the villagers more time to react.\n   - **Healing:** He keeps 5 spirit stones in reserve for emergency healing or to strengthen defenses later.\n\n3. **Command the Villagers:**\n   - Li Xiaoyao instructs the villagers to gather around the Spring, forming a protective circle. He assigns a few brave villagers to man the traps and watch for the Jiangshi's approach.\n   - He also distributes the Immortal Grass to the villagers, explaining that it can be used to restore health if they are injured during the battle.\n\n4. **Prepare for Combat:**\n   - As the Jiangshi draw closer, Li Xiaoyao readies himself for battle. He knows he must be swift and decisive. He positions himself at the front line, ready to engage the first wave of monsters.\n\n**Current Defense Strength: 50**\n**Next Wave of Monsters: Jiangshi (Strength: 20)**\n\n**Abilities of Jiangshi:**\n- **Life Drain:** Each Jiangshi can drain 5 health points from a villager or Li Xiaoyao upon contact.\n\n**Health Values:**\n- Li Xiaoyao: 30/30\n- Villagers: 20/20 (each)\n\n**Action:**\nLi Xiaoyao shouts to the villagers, \"Stay strong! Use the traps to your advantage, and remember the Immortal Grass if you need healing! We will protect the Spring of Life together!\"\n\nAs the Jiangshi approach, the traps are set, and the villagers are ready. The fate of the village hangs in the balance. What will Li Xiaoyao do next?",
