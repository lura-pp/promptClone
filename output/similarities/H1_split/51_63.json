    "H1_split_answer1": "The task involves analyzing a water sample that contains different concentrations of Fe(II) and Mn(II) ions. To determine their simultaneous presence, absorbance readings are taken at various wavelengths using differential spectrophotometry. This technique allows for the differentiation between the two ions based on their unique absorbance characteristics at specific wavelengths, enabling accurate quantification of each ion in the sample. By comparing the absorbance data, one can assess the concentrations of Fe(II) and Mn(II) in the water sample effectively.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "The task involves the simultaneous determination of Fe(II) and Mn(II) in a complex mixture of industrial wastewater using differential spectrophotometry. This method leverages the unique absorbance characteristics of each metal ion across various wavelengths to achieve accurate quantification. By analyzing the absorbance spectra, one can differentiate between the two ions and determine their concentrations effectively, even in the presence of other interfering substances commonly found in industrial wastewater.",
