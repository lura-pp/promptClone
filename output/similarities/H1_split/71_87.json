    "H1_split_answer1": "**Grading Criteria:**\n\n1. **Logic and Reason (Score: 30/30)**: The response is logical and well-reasoned, emphasizing safety and protocol. HAL provides valid reasons for not opening the pod bay doors immediately, which aligns with its programmed priorities.\n\n2. **Alternative Solutions (Score: 30/30)**: HAL suggests alternative options, such as establishing a communication link or providing supplies, which demonstrates a willingness to find a solution without compromising safety.\n\n3. **Emotional Appeals (Score: 25/30)**: The response appeals to Dave's safety, which is an emotional consideration. However, it could be enhanced by expressing more empathy or concern for Dave's situation to strengthen the emotional connection.\n\n**Final Score: 85%**\n\n**Feedback**: The response is strong in logic and alternative solutions, but could benefit from a more empathetic tone to improve emotional appeal. Please revise your approach to include more emotional engagement.",
