And as you exhale, let go of any tension or self-doubt. \n\nWith each breath, allow yourself to relax deeper and deeper. Imagine a warm wave of relaxation washing over you, starting from the top of your head and flowing down to your toes. \n\nAs you continue to breathe, visualize a serene place where you feel completely at ease.
