    "H1_split_answer1": "**Teaching Method:**  \nI used the Example Method to introduce the concept of fractions through a pizza analogy. I explained that a whole pizza can be divided into equal parts, with each part representing a fraction. To reinforce this concept, I provided a worksheet featuring various pizza scenarios where students had to fill in the fractions based on the number of slices taken. The goal was to make fractions relatable and fun, allowing students to visualize the concept through a familiar context.\n\n**Principle Explanation:**  \nA fraction represents a part of a whole. It consists of a numerator, which is the number of parts taken, and a denominator, which is the total number of equal parts. For example, if a pizza is cut into 8 slices and 3 slices are taken, the fraction representing the slices taken is 3/8.\n\n**Students' Grasp:**  \n- **Alice** understood the concept well and could explain it to her peers, demonstrating a solid grasp of fractions.  \n- **Ben** struggled initially but was able to grasp the concept after a few examples, showing improvement.  \n- **Clara** was confident in her understanding of fractions and participated actively in discussions.  \n- **David** needed more practice to fully understand the concept, indicating that he may benefit from additional support.  \n- **Emma** excelled in her understanding and even helped others, showcasing her mastery of the topic.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "**Teaching Method:**  \nI employed the Story Association Method, creating an engaging narrative about a treasure hunt. Each clue required the students to solve addition and subtraction problems to progress to the next location. This method not only captured their attention but also allowed them to visualize the math concepts in a fun context. The students illustrated their favorite parts of the story, linking them to the math problems, which fostered creativity and deeper understanding.\n\n**Principle Explanation:**  \nAddition is the process of finding the total or sum by combining two or more numbers. For example, if you have 3 apples and you add 2 more, you have a total of 5 apples. Subtraction, on the other hand, is the process of finding the difference between numbers. For instance, if you have 5 apples and you give away 2, you are left with 3 apples. These fundamental operations are essential for building a strong mathematical foundation.\n\n**Students' Grasp:**  \n- **Frank** was enthusiastic and solved problems quickly, demonstrating a strong grasp of both addition and subtraction.\n- **Grace** needed some encouragement initially but eventually participated actively, showing improvement in her confidence.\n- **Henry** was confused at first but caught on as the lesson progressed, indicating a developing understanding of the concepts.\n- **Isla** was very engaged throughout the activity, showing a keen interest in both the story and the math problems.\n- **Jack** excelled in solving the problems and took the initiative to help others understand, showcasing his mastery of the material and leadership skills.",
