    "H1_split_answer1": "Sure! Here\u2019s a structured breakdown of the process for documenting the setup of CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps, formatted for an Azure DevOps Wiki:\n\n# Setting Up CI/CD Pipelines in Azure DevOps\n\n## Introduction\nThis document outlines the process of setting up Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipelines in Azure DevOps. It covers creating a new project, configuring build and release pipelines, integrating with GitHub for source control, managing secrets and environment variables, and troubleshooting common issues.\n\n## Table of Contents\n1. [Creating a New Project](#creating-a-new-project)\n2. [Configuring Build Pipelines](#configuring-build-pipelines)\n3. [Configuring Release Pipelines](#configuring-release-pipelines)\n4. [Integrating with GitHub](#integrating-with-github)\n5. [Best Practices for Managing Secrets and Environment Variables](#best-practices-for-managing-secrets-and-environment-variables)\n6. [Troubleshooting Common Issues](#troubleshooting-common-issues)\n\n## Creating a New Project\n1. **Sign in to Azure DevOps**: Go to [Azure DevOps](https://dev.azure.com/) and sign in with your credentials.\n2. **Create a New Project**:\n   - Click on \"New Project\".\n   - Enter a project name and description.\n   - Choose the visibility (Public or Private).\n   - Click \"Create\".\n\n## Configuring Build Pipelines\n1. **Navigate to Pipelines**: In your project, select \"Pipelines\" from the left menu.\n2. **Create a New Pipeline**:\n   - Click on \"New Pipeline\".\n   - Choose the source where your code is hosted (e.g., GitHub, Azure Repos).\n   - Follow the prompts to configure your pipeline.\n3. **Define Build Steps**:\n   - Use the YAML editor or the classic editor to define build steps.\n   - Include tasks such as restoring dependencies, building the application, and running tests.\n\n## Configuring Release Pipelines\n1. **Navigate to Releases**: In the Pipelines section, select \"Releases\".\n2. **Create a New Release Pipeline**:\n   - Click on \"New\" and select \"New release pipeline\".\n   - Choose a template or start from scratch.\n3. **Add Stages**:\n   - Define stages for different environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).\n   - Configure deployment tasks for each stage.\n\n## Integrating with GitHub\n1. **Link GitHub Repository**:\n   - In your Azure DevOps project, go to \"Project Settings\" > \"Service connections\".\n   - Click on \"New service connection\" and select GitHub.\n   - Authenticate and authorize Azure DevOps to access your GitHub account.\n2. **Set Up CI Triggers**:\n   - In your build pipeline, configure triggers to start builds on code pushes or pull requests.\n\n## Best Practices for Managing Secrets and Environment Variables\n- **Use Azure Key Vault**: Store sensitive information like API keys and connection strings in Azure Key Vault.\n- **Environment Variables**: Define environment variables in your pipeline settings to manage configuration settings without hardcoding them.\n- **Secure Files**: Use the secure files feature in Azure DevOps to manage files that need to be used in your pipelines securely.\n\n## Troubleshooting Common Issues\n- **Build Failures**: Check the build logs for error messages and ensure all dependencies are correctly configured.\n- **Deployment Issues**: Verify that the correct service connections are set up and that the target environment is accessible.\n- **Secrets Not Found**: Ensure that the service principal used by Azure DevOps has access to the Azure Key Vault.\n\n## Conclusion\nSetting up CI/CD pipelines in Azure DevOps can streamline your development process and improve deployment efficiency. By following the steps outlined in this document and adhering to best practices, you can create a robust CI/CD workflow.\n\n---\n\nFeel free to provide any additional information or specific details you'd like to include, and I can help refine this document further!",
