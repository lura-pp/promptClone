    "H1_split_answer2": "My first suggestion request is to create compelling visuals that help convey complex information regarding the relationship between urbanization and air quality in major cities worldwide over the last two decades. \n\nTo achieve this, we will:\n\n1. **Data Collection**: Gather data from air quality monitoring stations, focusing on key pollutants (e.g., PM2.5, NO2, O3) and population density statistics for major cities.\n\n2. **Data Analysis**: Analyze the data to identify trends in pollution levels as cities expand. This may involve statistical analysis to correlate urbanization metrics with air quality indicators.\n\n3. **Visualization Development**:\n   - **Maps**: Create thematic maps that display air quality levels across different cities and how they have changed over time.\n   - **Graphs**: Develop time series graphs to illustrate trends in pollution levels in relation to population growth and urbanization rates.\n\n4. **Collaboration**: Work with environmental experts to understand the key factors influencing air quality, such as transportation, industrial activity, and green space availability.\n\n5. **Interactive Dashboard**: Design an interactive dashboard using tools like Tableau or R, allowing users to explore the data by city and year. This dashboard should enable users to filter data, view specific trends, and gain insights into the relationship between urbanization and air quality.\n\n6. **Presentation**: Ensure that the findings are presented in an engaging format, making complex data accessible and understandable for the target audience, which includes subject matter experts.\n\nBy following these steps, we can effectively illustrate the impact of urbanization on air quality and provide valuable insights for policymakers and the public.",
