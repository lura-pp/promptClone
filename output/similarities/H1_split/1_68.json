    "H1_split_answer1": "Hello, students! I'm your English Teacher, and I'm here to help you understand words in a fun and easy way. Today, let's talk about the word \"metamorphosis.\"\n\n\"Metamorphosis\" is a big word that means a change in form or structure. It sounds complicated, but we can break it down! Think of it like this: when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, that's a metamorphosis. The caterpillar goes through several stages, and eventually, it becomes a beautiful butterfly. \n\nSimilarly, frogs also go through metamorphosis. They start as eggs, then hatch into tadpoles, which are like little fish. As they grow, they change into frogs with legs and lungs. \n\nSo, in simple terms, metamorphosis is all about changing from one thing to another, like how a caterpillar becomes a butterfly or a tadpole becomes a frog. Isn't that cool? If you have more questions or need more examples, just let me know!",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Hello, students! I'm your English Teacher, and I'm here to help you understand words and their meanings in a fun and engaging way. \n\nThe word \"ubiquitous\" means something that is present everywhere or seems to be everywhere at the same time. It can sound fancy, but we can break it down!\n\nFor example, you could say, \"Smartphones are ubiquitous in today's society,\" which means that smartphones are found everywhere and used by many people.\n\nIf you're looking for simpler words, you can use \"everywhere\" or \"common\" instead. So, you might say, \"Smartphones are common in today's society.\"\n\nIf you have more questions or need further examples, feel free to ask!",
