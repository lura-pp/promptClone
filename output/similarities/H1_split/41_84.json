    "H1_split_answer1": "To effectively manage the distributed software development team working on the cloud-based e-commerce platform, the AI-managed system should implement the following strategies:\n\n### Task Allocation\n1. **Skill-Based Assignment**: \n   - Front-end developers proficient in React should be assigned tasks related to user interface development.\n   - Back-end developers with expertise in Node.js should handle server-side logic and database interactions.\n   - QA engineers specializing in automated testing should focus on creating and executing test cases for each component.\n\n2. **Time Zone Consideration**: \n   - Allocate tasks considering the time zones of team members (New York, London, Tokyo) to ensure that work can progress continuously. For example, assign tasks to team members in New York during their working hours, and as they complete tasks, hand off to team members in London and then Tokyo.\n\n### Monitoring Progress\n1. **Automated Progress Tracking**: \n   - Implement a system that automatically tracks the progress of each task and component. This can include status updates, completion percentages, and any blockers encountered.\n\n2. **Daily Stand-Up Meetings**: \n   - Facilitate virtual stand-up meetings at a time that accommodates all time zones. Use a rotating schedule to ensure fairness in meeting times. During these meetings, team members can share updates, discuss challenges, and align on priorities.\n\n### Conflict Resolution\n1. **Proactive Identification of Bottlenecks**: \n   - The AI should analyze task dependencies and workloads to identify potential bottlenecks or conflicts arising from overlapping tasks. For instance, if two developers are assigned to similar tasks, the AI can suggest reallocation.\n\n2. **Resource Management**: \n   - Monitor resource availability and workload to prevent shortages. If a developer is overloaded, the AI can suggest redistributing tasks to other team members with available capacity.\n\n### Deadline Management\n1. **Milestone Tracking**: \n   - Set clear deadlines for each component (user authentication, product catalog, payment processing) and monitor adherence to these deadlines. The AI should send reminders and alerts as deadlines approach.\n\n2. **Adjustment Recommendations**: \n   - If a team member is falling behind, the AI can suggest adjustments to the project timeline or reallocate tasks to ensure that overall project deadlines are met.\n\n### Communication Facilitation\n1. **Seamless Collaboration Tools**: \n   - Integrate communication tools (e.g., Slack, Microsoft Teams) to facilitate real-time collaboration among team members. Ensure that all discussions and decisions are documented for transparency.\n\n2. **Feedback Loops**: \n   - Establish mechanisms for team members to provide feedback on task assignments and project progress, allowing for continuous improvement in the workflow.\n\nBy implementing these strategies, the AI-managed system can effectively oversee and coordinate the distributed software development team, ensuring timely delivery and successful completion of the e-commerce platform project.",
