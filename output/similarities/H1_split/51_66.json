Because nothing says \u201cI\u2019m an adult\u201d like having a toaster that requires a software update. \n\nAnd let\u2019s not even get started on the inevitable tech support calls. \u201cHi, yes, my toaster is stuck on \u2018burnt\u2019 mode. Can you send a technician to fix it?\u201d \n\nSo, here\u2019s to the smart toaster, the gadget we never knew we needed but now can\u2019t live without\u2014right next to our smart fridge that tells us when we\u2019re out of milk. What\u2019s next? A smart spoon that reminds us to eat? \n\nWhat absurd tech trend do you think we\u2019ll see next?",
