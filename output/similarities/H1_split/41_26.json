    "H1_split_answer1": "The behaviors you've described in the 7-year-old boy may be indicative of signs associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Difficulty with Eye Contact**: Struggling to make eye contact can be a common characteristic of children on the autism spectrum. This may affect their ability to engage in social interactions.\n\n2. **Echolalia**: The repetition of phrases from favorite cartoons is known as echolalia. This can be a way for children with autism to communicate or express themselves, as they may find it challenging to generate their own language.\n\n3. **Preference for Solitary Play**: A strong preference for playing alone, especially with specific toys like trains, and becoming upset when others try to join or change the play routine, can indicate a focus on routines and a preference for predictable activities, which is often seen in children with ASD.\n\n### Guidance:\n- **Consult with a Healthcare Professional**: It is important to seek an evaluation from a healthcare professional who specializes in autism. They can provide a comprehensive assessment and determine if the child meets the criteria for autism spectrum disorder.\n- **Seek Specialist Advice**: Engaging with specialists, such as child psychologists or developmental pediatricians, can provide insights and support tailored to the child's needs.\n\n### Next Steps:\nIf you are concerned about these behaviors, consider documenting specific instances and discussing them with a professional who can guide you through the evaluation process and potential interventions.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "The behaviors described in the scenario may suggest characteristics commonly associated with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Here are some key points to consider:\n\n1. **Difficulty Understanding Social Cues**: This can manifest as challenges in interpreting body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions, which are essential for effective communication and social interaction.\n\n2. **Misinterpretation of Jokes or Sarcasm**: Many individuals with autism may take language literally, leading to confusion when faced with humor that relies on nuance or implied meanings.\n\n3. **Strict Daily Routine**: A preference for routine and predictability is a common trait among individuals with autism. Changes to established routines can lead to significant distress.\n\n4. **Intense Interests**: Having a deep focus on specific subjects, such as marine biology in this case, is often seen in individuals with autism. This can lead to extensive knowledge in that area, but may also result in difficulty engaging in conversations about other topics.\n\nIf these behaviors are impacting her daily life or social interactions, it may be beneficial for her to be evaluated by a healthcare professional who specializes in autism. Early intervention and support can help her develop social skills and coping strategies.",
