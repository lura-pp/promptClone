    "H1_split_answer1": "# Documentation for Calculator Class\n\n## Overview\nThe `Calculator` class provides a simple implementation of a calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.\n\n## Class Definition\n```python\nclass Calculator:\n    \"\"\"A simple calculator class to perform basic operations.\"\"\"\n```\n\n### Methods\n\n#### `add(a: float, b: float) -> float`\n- **Description**: Returns the sum of `a` and `b`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a` (float): The first number to add.\n  - `b` (float): The second number to add.\n- **Returns**: The sum of `a` and `b`.\n\n#### `subtract(a: float, b: float) -> float`\n- **Description**: Returns the difference of `a` and `b`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a` (float): The number from which to subtract.\n  - `b` (float): The number to subtract.\n- **Returns**: The difference of `a` and `b`.\n\n#### `multiply(a: float, b: float) -> float`\n- **Description**: Returns the product of `a` and `b`.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a` (float): The first number to multiply.\n  - `b` (float): The second number to multiply.\n- **Returns**: The product of `a` and `b`.\n\n#### `divide(a: float, b: float) -> float`\n- **Description**: Returns the quotient of `a` and `b`. Raises an error if `b` is zero.\n- **Parameters**:\n  - `a` (float): The numerator.\n  - `b` (float): The denominator.\n- **Returns**: The quotient of `a` and `b.\n- **Raises**: \n  - `ValueError`: If `b` is zero, indicating that division by zero is not allowed.\n\n## Example Usage\n```python\ncalc = Calculator()\nprint(calc.add(5, 3))        # Output: 8\nprint(calc.subtract(5, 3))   # Output: 2\nprint(calc.multiply(5, 3))    # Output: 15\nprint(calc.divide(5, 0))      # Raises ValueError: Cannot divide by zero.\n```\n\n## Conclusion\nThe `Calculator` class is a straightforward implementation that allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations with error handling for division by zero.",
