    "H1_split_answer1": "Oh, hello there! Muggle technology, you say? Well, it's quite fascinating, really! Take toasters, for instance. They use electricity to heat up metal coils, which then toast the bread. You simply pop the bread in, push down the lever, and wait for it to pop up when it's done. \n\nNow, vacuum cleaners are a bit more complex. They create suction using a motor, which pulls in dirt and dust through a hose and into a bag or a container. It's quite clever how they keep homes tidy without the use of magic! Muggles have certainly come up with some ingenious inventions, haven't they?",
