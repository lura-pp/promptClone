    "H1_split_answer1": "Sure! Let's break down the concept of probability, including the differences between theoretical and experimental probability, and how to calculate the probability of multiple independent events.\n\n### What is Probability?\n\nProbability is a measure of how likely an event is to occur. It is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 indicates that the event will not happen, and 1 indicates that the event will definitely happen. \n\n### Theoretical Probability\n\nTheoretical probability is calculated based on the possible outcomes in a perfect scenario. It is determined using the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\\text{Total number of possible outcomes}}\n\\]\n\n**Example of Theoretical Probability:**\nConsider a standard six-sided die. The probability of rolling a 3 is:\n\n- Favorable outcomes: 1 (only one side shows a 3)\n- Total outcomes: 6 (sides of the die)\n\nSo, the theoretical probability \\( P(3) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP(3) = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\n### Experimental Probability\n\nExperimental probability is based on the actual results of an experiment or trial. It is calculated using the formula:\n\n\\[\nP(A) = \\frac{\\text{Number of times event A occurs}}{\\text{Total number of trials}}\n\\]\n\n**Example of Experimental Probability:**\nIf you roll a die 60 times and get a 3 on 10 of those rolls, the experimental probability of rolling a 3 is:\n\n- Number of times event A occurs: 10\n- Total number of trials: 60\n\nSo, the experimental probability \\( P(3) \\) is:\n\n\\[\nP(3) = \\frac{10}{60} = \\frac{1}{6} \\approx 0.1667\n\\]\n\n### Calculating Probability of Multiple Independent Events\n\nWhen calculating the probability of multiple independent events occurring together, you multiply the probabilities of each individual event. If events A and B are independent, the probability of both A and B occurring is given by:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B)\n\\]\n\n**Example:**\nSuppose you want to find the probability of rolling a 2 on a die and flipping a coin to get heads.\n\n- Probability of rolling a 2 on a die: \\( P(A) = \\frac{1}{6} \\)\n- Probability of flipping heads: \\( P(B) = \\frac{1}{2} \\)\n\nThe combined probability of both events occurring is:\n\n\\[\nP(A \\text{ and } B) = P(A) \\times P(B) = \\frac{1}{6} \\times \\frac{1}{2} = \\frac{1}{12} \\approx 0.0833\n\\]\n\n### Summary\n\n- **Theoretical Probability** is based on the possible outcomes and is calculated using favorable outcomes over total outcomes.\n- **Experimental Probability** is based on actual trials and is calculated using the number of times an event occurs over the total number of trials.\n- For multiple independent events, multiply their individual probabilities to find the combined probability.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need more examples, feel free to ask!",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Sure! Let's break down the concept of conditional probability, how it differs from regular probability, and provide a real-world example. We'll also discuss Bayes' theorem and its practical applications.\n\n### What is Conditional Probability?\n\n**Conditional probability** is the probability of an event occurring given that another event has already occurred. It is denoted as \\( P(A | B) \\), which reads as \"the probability of event A given event B.\"\n\n### How Does It Differ from Regular Probability?\n\n**Regular probability** (or unconditional probability) refers to the likelihood of an event occurring without any conditions. For example, if you want to find the probability of rolling a 3 on a fair six-sided die, it is simply \\( P(3) = \\frac{1}{6} \\).\n\nIn contrast, conditional probability takes into account the occurrence of another event. For example, if you want to find the probability of drawing a red card from a standard deck of cards given that the card drawn is a heart, you would use conditional probability.\n\n### Formula for Conditional Probability\n\nThe formula for conditional probability is:\n\n\\[\nP(A | B) = \\frac{P(A \\cap B)}{P(B)}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A | B) \\) is the conditional probability of A given B.\n- \\( P(A \\cap B) \\) is the probability of both A and B occurring.\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of B occurring.\n\n### Real-World Example\n\nLet's say you have a bag containing 3 red balls and 2 blue balls. You want to find the probability of drawing a red ball given that you have already drawn a ball and it was blue.\n\n1. **Define Events**:\n   - Let A = drawing a red ball.\n   - Let B = drawing a blue ball.\n\n2. **Calculate Probabilities**:\n   - \\( P(A) = \\frac{3}{5} \\) (probability of drawing a red ball)\n   - \\( P(B) = \\frac{2}{5} \\) (probability of drawing a blue ball)\n   - \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\) (you cannot draw a red ball and a blue ball at the same time)\n\n3. **Calculate Conditional Probability**:\n   - Since \\( P(A \\cap B) = 0 \\), we find that \\( P(A | B) = 0 \\). This means if you have drawn a blue ball, the probability of drawing a red ball is 0.\n\n### Bayes' Theorem\n\n**Bayes' theorem** is a way to find a conditional probability when you know the reverse conditional probability. It is expressed as:\n\n\\[\nP(A | B) = \\frac{P(B | A) \\cdot P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( P(A | B) \\) is the probability of A given B.\n- \\( P(B | A) \\) is the probability of B given A.\n- \\( P(A) \\) is the probability of A.\n- \\( P(B) \\) is the probability of B.\n\n### Practical Application of Bayes' Theorem\n\nLet's say you want to determine the probability that a person has a disease (A) given that they tested positive for it (B). \n\n1. **Define Probabilities**:\n   - \\( P(A) \\): Probability of having the disease (e.g., 1% or 0.01).\n   - \\( P(B | A) \\): Probability of testing positive if you have the disease (e.g., 90% or 0.9).\n   - \\( P(B) \\): Total probability of testing positive, which can be calculated using the law of total probability.\n\n2. **Calculate \\( P(B) \\)**:\n   - This includes both true positives and false positives. If the test has a 5% false positive rate and 99% of the population does not have the disease, you can calculate \\( P(B) \\).\n\n3. **Apply Bayes' Theorem**:\n   - Plug the values into Bayes' theorem to find \\( P(A | B) \\), the probability of having the disease given a positive test result.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nConditional probability helps us understand the likelihood of events based on prior knowledge, while Bayes' theorem provides a powerful tool for updating our beliefs based on new evidence.
