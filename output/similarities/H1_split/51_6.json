    "H1_split_answer1": "Global warming represents a profound danger to the future of our planet, primarily fueled by the unchecked emission of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. These gases function like a thermal blanket, trapping heat from the sun and leading to a dramatic rise in global temperatures. The consequences are alarming: we are witnessing the rapid melting of ice caps, rising sea levels, and increasingly severe weather events. \n\nIt is crucial that we take immediate action to address global warming and reduce our carbon footprint. Each of us has a vital role in this urgent battle. By embracing sustainable practices, minimizing energy consumption, and advocating for meaningful policy changes, we can collectively drive significant change. Together, we can make a difference in the fight against this pressing issue.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Global warming represents an urgent crisis that threatens the health of our planet. This phenomenon arises from the excessive release of greenhouse gases, which accumulate in the atmosphere and create a greenhouse effect, resulting in a perilous rise in global temperatures. The consequences of this warming trend are catastrophic, including the swift melting of polar ice, rising sea levels, and unpredictable weather extremes. \n\nTo prevent further damage, it is crucial that we take decisive action immediately. Individuals can play a vital role by adopting eco-friendly habits, reducing waste, and supporting renewable energy initiatives. By working together, we can pave the way toward a sustainable future and safeguard our environment for generations to come.",
