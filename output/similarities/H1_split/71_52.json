Man, they just can't compare.  \n\nState management's a breeze, with Redux in my crew,  \nWhile you're tangled in services, what you gonna do?  \nSo step aside, Angular, let the real deal shine,  \nIn the world of frameworks, I'm the one that's divine.  \n\nHooks got me flexin', reusing code like a pro,  \nWhile Angular's directives just steal the show slow.  \nI got my community, we\u2019re building with pride,  \nWith every new release, I\u2019m the one they ride.  \n\nSo if you want speed, and a UI that\u2019s clean,  \nJoin the ReactJS fam, you know what I mean!  \nFrom components to props, we\u2019re breaking the mold,  \nIn this JavaScript battle, watch my story unfold.",
