    "H1_split_answer1": "Here are three disturbing facts about space:\n\n1. In the vacuum of space, sound cannot travel, meaning if you were to scream, no one would hear you. This eerie silence highlights the isolation of space, where communication becomes impossible without technology.\n\n2. Space is filled with harmful radiation, including cosmic rays and ultraviolet radiation. Without proper protection, humans exposed to this radiation can suffer severe health consequences, including increased cancer risk.\n\n3. The universe is expanding at an accelerating rate, driven by dark energy. This means galaxies are moving away from each other, and in the distant future, our night sky may become eerily empty, with many stars no longer visible to us.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Here are three disturbing facts about space:\n\n1. In the vacuum of space, an unprotected human would lose consciousness within about 15 seconds due to the lack of oxygen. The body would then experience ebullism, where bodily fluids begin to vaporize, leading to severe swelling and potential tissue damage.\n\n2. Space is a realm of extreme temperatures. Without a spacesuit, an astronaut would face temperatures ranging from scorching heat in direct sunlight to frigid cold in the shadow of celestial bodies, making survival impossible without proper protection.\n\n3. Black holes are among the most terrifying phenomena in the universe. Their gravitational pull is so intense that not even light can escape, creating a \"point of no return\" known as the event horizon. Once crossed, anything is doomed to be consumed by the black hole's singularity.",
