    "H1_split_answer1": "To create a Dune dashboard that visualizes the total value locked (TVL) in various DeFi protocols over the past year, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Data Sources\n1. **Identify Data Sources**: Ensure you have access to the necessary blockchain data for protocols like Uniswap, Aave, and Compound. You may need to query data from Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, and other relevant blockchains.\n\n### Step 2: SQL Queries\n2. **Write SQL Queries**: Create SQL queries to extract the TVL data for each protocol. Here\u2019s a basic structure for your queries:\n\n   ```sql\n   -- Example query for Uniswap TVL\n   SELECT \n       DATE(block_time) AS date,\n       SUM(value_locked) AS uniswap_tvl\n   FROM \n       uniswap_data\n   WHERE \n       block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'\n   GROUP BY \n       date\n   ORDER BY \n       date;\n\n   -- Repeat similar queries for Aave and Compound\n   ```\n\n### Step 3: Combine Data\n3. **Combine Data**: Use a UNION or JOIN to combine the TVL data from different protocols into a single dataset for easier comparison.\n\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n       date,\n       SUM(uniswap_tvl) AS uniswap_tvl,\n       SUM(aave_tvl) AS aave_tvl,\n       SUM(compound_tvl) AS compound_tvl\n   FROM \n       (/* Your individual protocol queries here */) AS combined_data\n   GROUP BY \n       date\n   ORDER BY \n       date;\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Create Visualizations\n4. **Create Visualizations**: In Dune, use the visualization tools to create charts and graphs. Consider the following:\n   - **Line Chart**: For TVL over time for each protocol.\n   - **Bar Chart**: For comparing TVL on different blockchains.\n   - **Pie Chart**: For breakdown of TVL by asset type.\n\n### Step 5: Add Filters\n5. **Add Filters**: Implement filters for different blockchains and protocols. This allows users to customize their view:\n   - **Blockchain Filter**: Dropdown to select Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, etc.\n   - **Protocol Filter**: Checkbox or dropdown to select Uniswap, Aave, Compound.\n\n### Step 6: Real-Time Data\n6. **Ensure Real-Time Updates**: Set up your queries to refresh at regular intervals to provide real-time data. Dune allows you to schedule updates for your dashboard.\n\n### Step 7: Dashboard Layout\n7. **Design the Dashboard**: Organize your visualizations and filters in a user-friendly layout. Ensure that the most important information is easily accessible.\n\n### Step 8: Documentation\n8. **Provide Documentation**: Include a brief guide on how to use the dashboard, explaining the filters and visualizations.\n\n### Example SQL for TVL Breakdown by Asset Type\n```sql\nSELECT \n    asset_type,\n    SUM(value_locked) AS total_tvl\nFROM \n    tvl_data\nWHERE \n    block_time >= NOW() - INTERVAL '1 year'\nGROUP BY \n    asset_type;\n```\n\n### Final Steps\n- **Test the Dashboard**: Before sharing, test the dashboard to ensure all functionalities work as expected.\n- **Share the Dashboard**: Once completed, share the dashboard link with your intended audience.\n\nBy following these steps, you will create a comprehensive Dune dashboard that effectively visualizes the total value locked in various DeFi protocols, allowing users to analyze and compare their performance over the past year.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "To develop a Dune dashboard that tracks transaction volume and user activity for decentralized exchanges (DEXs) on Ethereum, follow these steps:\n\n### Step 1: Define the Metrics\n1. **Daily Active Users (DAU)**: Count of unique wallet addresses interacting with DEXs each day.\n2. **Average Transaction Size**: Total transaction volume divided by the number of transactions for a specific period.\n3. **Liquidity Pool Performance**: Metrics such as total liquidity, volume, and fees generated by liquidity pools.\n\n### Step 2: Data Sources\nUtilize Dune's existing tables and views that contain transaction data for Ethereum DEXs. Key tables may include:\n- `ethereum.transactions`\n- `ethereum.dex_trades`\n- `ethereum.liquidity_pools`\n\n### Step 3: Write SQL Queries\nCreate SQL queries to extract the required metrics. Here are examples of what those queries might look like:\n\n1. **Daily Active Users**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n       DATE(block_time) AS date,\n       COUNT(DISTINCT from_address) AS daily_active_users\n   FROM \n       ethereum.dex_trades\n   GROUP BY \n       date\n   ORDER BY \n       date DESC;\n   ```\n\n2. **Average Transaction Size**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n       DATE(block_time) AS date,\n       AVG(value) AS average_transaction_size\n   FROM \n       ethereum.dex_trades\n   GROUP BY \n       date\n   ORDER BY \n       date DESC;\n   ```\n\n3. **Liquidity Pool Performance**:\n   ```sql\n   SELECT \n       pool_address,\n       SUM(value) AS total_liquidity,\n       SUM(volume) AS total_volume,\n       SUM(fees) AS total_fees\n   FROM \n       ethereum.liquidity_pools\n   GROUP BY \n       pool_address;\n   ```\n\n### Step 4: Create the Dashboard\n1. **Visualizations**:\n   - Use line charts for Daily Active Users and Average Transaction Size over time.\n   - Use bar charts or tables for Liquidity Pool Performance.\n\n2. **Time Frame Selector**:\n   - Implement a date range filter that allows users to select specific time frames for their analysis.\n\n3. **Export Feature**:\n   - Add an export button that allows users to download the displayed data in CSV format for further analysis.\n\n### Step 5: Documentation\nProvide clear documentation on how to use the dashboard, including:\n- How to interpret the metrics.\n- Instructions for using the time frame selector.\n- Steps to export data.\n\n### Step 6: Testing and Iteration\n- Test the dashboard with real data to ensure accuracy.\n- Gather feedback from users and iterate on the design and functionality as needed.\n\n### Step 7: Publish the Dashboard\nOnce finalized, publish the dashboard on Dune and share it with the community for use.\n\n### Additional Resources\nRefer to the Dune documentation for specific details on SQL syntax, dashboard creation, and data export functionalities: [Dune Documentation](https://dune.com/docs/).\n\nBy following these steps, you will create a comprehensive Dune dashboard that effectively tracks transaction volume and user activity for DEXs on Ethereum.",
