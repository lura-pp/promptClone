    "H1_split_answer1": "To create a dazzling Valentine\u2019s Day stamp featuring Rem from Re:Zero, follow these design guidelines:\n\n1. **Character Design**: Start with a vibrant and detailed illustration of Rem, capturing her iconic features and expressions. Ensure she is depicted in a way that reflects her personality and charm.\n\n2. **Heart-Shaped Border**: Design a heart-shaped border around the stamp. This border should have a sparkling effect, perhaps using gradients or glitter textures to give it a magical feel.\n\n3. **Embossed Texture**: Incorporate an embossed texture into the heart-shaped border to add depth and a tactile quality. This can be achieved by using shading and highlights to create a 3D effect.\n\n4. **Background**: For the background, design it to resemble old parchment. Use warm, earthy tones and subtle textures to mimic the look of aged paper. This will provide a nice contrast to the vibrant colors of Rem and the sparkling border.\n\n5. **Resolution**: Ensure that the entire design is created in 16K Resolution to maintain high quality and detail, making it suitable for printing or digital use.\n\n6. **Final Touches**: Add any additional elements that resonate with the theme of love and adventure, such as small hearts or magical sparkles around Rem.\n\nHappy creating your Valentine\u2019s Day stamp for Rem! \u2764\ufe0f",
