    "H1_split_answer1": "Existentialism is a philosophical movement that emphasizes individual existence, freedom, and choice. It posits that individuals are responsible for giving their own lives meaning and that they must navigate a world that is often absurd and devoid of inherent purpose. This philosophy emerged in the 20th century, with key figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre and Simone de Beauvoir playing significant roles in its development.\n\n### Key Concepts of Existentialism\n\n1. **Existence Precedes Essence**: This is one of Sartre's fundamental ideas, suggesting that individuals are not born with a predetermined purpose. Instead, they must create their own essence through actions and choices.\n\n2. **Freedom and Responsibility**: Existentialists argue that with freedom comes the burden of responsibility. Individuals must confront the consequences of their choices, which can lead to feelings of anxiety and despair. Sartre famously stated, \"Man is condemned to be free,\" highlighting that freedom is both a gift and a curse.\n\n3. **Authenticity**: This concept refers to living in accordance with one's true self, rather than conforming to societal expectations. Authenticity requires self-awareness and the courage to make choices that reflect one's values and beliefs.\n\n### Key Figures\n\n- **Jean-Paul Sartre**: A leading figure in existentialism, Sartre's works, such as \"Being and Nothingness\" and \"Existentialism is a Humanism,\" explore the nature of existence, freedom, and the human condition. He emphasizes that individuals must take responsibility for their actions and the meanings they create.\n\n- **Simone de Beauvoir**: A prominent existentialist and feminist thinker, de Beauvoir is best known for her book \"The Second Sex,\" where she examines the construction of women's oppression and advocates for women's freedom and autonomy. She argues that one must transcend societal roles to achieve true freedom.\n\n### Examples in Literature and Film\n\n1. **Literature**:\n   - **\"Nausea\" by Jean-Paul Sartre**: This novel explores the protagonist's existential crisis as he grapples with the absurdity of existence and the realization that life lacks inherent meaning.\n   - **\"The Stranger\" by Albert Camus**: Although Camus is often associated with absurdism, his work reflects existential themes. The protagonist, Meursault, embodies the idea of living authentically in a world that seems indifferent to human existence.\n\n2. **Film**:\n   - **\"The Seventh Seal\" (1957)**: Directed by Ingmar Bergman, this film features a knight who plays chess with Death, exploring themes of existential dread, the search for meaning, and the confrontation with mortality.\n   - **\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\" (2004)**: This film delves into the complexities of memory, love, and identity, highlighting the characters' struggles with their choices and the desire for authenticity in relationships.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nExistentialism challenges individuals to confront their freedom and the responsibilities that come with it. Through the works of Sartre, de Beauvoir, and various literary and cinematic examples, we see the profound implications of living authentically in a world that often feels chaotic and meaningless. The exploration of these themes encourages a deeper understanding of the human experience and the quest for personal significance.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "Utilitarianism and deontological ethics represent two significant approaches to moral philosophy, each with distinct implications for ethical decision-making. \n\n### Utilitarianism\n\nUtilitarianism, primarily associated with philosophers like John Stuart Mill, posits that the morality of an action is determined by its consequences. The central tenet is the \"greatest happiness principle,\" which suggests that actions are right if they promote the greatest happiness for the greatest number. Mill expanded on Jeremy Bentham's ideas, emphasizing qualitative differences in pleasures and advocating for higher pleasures (intellectual and moral) over lower pleasures (bodily and sensual).\n\n**Real-World Scenario: Trolley Problem**\n\nConsider the classic trolley problem: a runaway trolley is heading towards five people tied to the tracks. You can pull a lever to divert the trolley onto another track, where it will kill one person instead. A utilitarian approach would advocate for pulling the lever, as it results in the least harm (one death instead of five), maximizing overall happiness.\n\n### Deontological Ethics\n\nIn contrast, deontological ethics, most notably articulated by Immanuel Kant, argues that the morality of an action is based on whether it adheres to a set of rules or duties, regardless of the consequences. Kant's categorical imperative emphasizes that one should act only according to that maxim which one can will to become a universal law. This framework prioritizes the inherent dignity and rights of individuals, asserting that certain actions are morally obligatory, irrespective of their outcomes.\n\n**Real-World Scenario: Trolley Problem Revisited**\n\nApplying Kantian ethics to the trolley problem would lead to a different conclusion. Kant would argue against pulling the lever, as it involves using the one person on the other track merely as a means to save five others. For Kant, the act of intentionally causing harm to an innocent person is morally impermissible, regardless of the potential benefits.\n\n### Philosophical Implications\n\nThe implications of these two ethical frameworks are profound:\n\n1. **Moral Responsibility**: Utilitarianism can lead to justifying harmful actions if they result in a net positive outcome, potentially allowing for morally questionable decisions in the name of greater good. Deontological ethics, however, emphasizes moral absolutes, which can protect individual rights but may lead to rigid moral stances that ignore context.\n\n2. **Complexity of Human Experience**: Utilitarianism's focus on outcomes can oversimplify complex moral situations, reducing human experiences to mere calculations of pleasure and pain. Deontological ethics, while providing clear rules, may struggle with situations where duties conflict, leading to moral dilemmas.\n\n3. **Real-World Applications**: In policy-making, utilitarianism might support actions like sacrificing individual privacy for national security if it benefits the majority. Conversely, deontological ethics would resist such actions, emphasizing the importance of individual rights and ethical standards that should not be violated.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nBoth utilitarianism and deontological ethics offer valuable insights into moral reasoning, yet they can lead to divergent conclusions in practical scenarios. Understanding these frameworks allows for a more nuanced approach to ethical dilemmas, encouraging individuals to consider both the consequences of their actions and the moral principles that guide them. Engaging with the works of Mill and Kant enriches this discourse, providing foundational perspectives that continue to influence contemporary ethical discussions.",
