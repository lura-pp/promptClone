    "H1_split_answer1": "Here's an analysis of a simple Python banking system that includes classes for `Account` and `Transaction`. This program allows users to create accounts, perform deposits and withdrawals, and check their balances. It also includes exception handling for scenarios like insufficient funds.\n\n### Program Structure\n\n1. **Classes**:\n   - **Account**: Represents a bank account with methods for depositing, withdrawing, and checking the balance.\n   - **Transaction**: Represents a transaction that can be either a deposit or a withdrawal.\n\n### Code Implementation\n\n```python\nclass InsufficientFundsError(Exception):\n    \"\"\"Custom exception for insufficient funds during withdrawal.\"\"\"\n    pass\n\nclass Account:\n    def __init__(self, account_number, account_holder):\n        self.account_number = account_number\n        self.account_holder = account_holder\n        self.balance = 0.0\n\n    def deposit(self, amount):\n        if amount <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Deposit amount must be positive.\")\n        self.balance += amount\n        print(f\"Deposited: ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def withdraw(self, amount):\n        if amount <= 0:\n            raise ValueError(\"Withdrawal amount must be positive.\")\n        if amount > self.balance:\n            raise InsufficientFundsError(\"Insufficient funds for this withdrawal.\")\n        self.balance -= amount\n        print(f\"Withdrew: ${amount:.2f}. New balance: ${self.balance:.2f}\")\n\n    def get_balance(self):\n        return self.balance\n\nclass Transaction:\n    def __init__(self, account, transaction_type, amount):\n        self.account = account\n        self.transaction_type = transaction_type\n        self.amount = amount\n\n    def execute(self):\n        if self.transaction_type == 'deposit':\n            self.account.deposit(self.amount)\n        elif self.transaction_type == 'withdraw':\n            try:\n                self.account.withdraw(self.amount)\n            except InsufficientFundsError as e:\n                print(e)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    # Create an account\n    account1 = Account(\"123456\", \"John Doe\")\n\n    # Perform transactions\n    try:\n        account1.deposit(1000)  # Deposit $1000\n        account1.withdraw(500)   # Withdraw $500\n        account1.withdraw(600)   # Attempt to withdraw $600 (should raise an exception)\n    except ValueError as e:\n        print(e)\n\n    # Check balance\n    print(f\"Final balance: ${account1.get_balance():.2f}\")\n```\n\n### Features Demonstrated\n\n1. **Creating Accounts**:\n   - An account is created by instantiating the `Account` class with an account number and account holder's name.\n\n2. **Performing Transactions**:\n   - The `deposit` method allows adding funds to the account.\n   - The `withdraw` method allows removing funds, with checks for sufficient balance.\n\n3. **Handling Exceptions**:\n   - The program raises a custom `InsufficientFundsError` if a withdrawal exceeds the current balance.\n   - It also raises a `ValueError` for invalid deposit or withdrawal amounts (e.g., negative values).\n\n### Example Usage\n\n- **Creating an Account**:\n  ```python\n  account1 = Account(\"123456\", \"John Doe\")\n  ```\n\n- **Depositing Funds**:\n  ```python\n  account1.deposit(1000)  # Deposits $1000\n  ```\n\n- **Withdrawing Funds**:\n  ```python\n  account1.withdraw(500)   # Withdraws $500\n  ```\n\n- **Handling Insufficient Funds**:\n  ```python\n  account1.withdraw(600)   # This will raise an InsufficientFundsError\n  ```\n\n- **Checking Balance**:\n  ```python\n  print(f\"Final balance: ${account1.get_balance():.2f}\")\n  ```\n\n### Conclusion\n\nThis simple banking system effectively demonstrates object-oriented programming principles in Python, including encapsulation, exception handling, and class interactions. The design allows for easy expansion, such as adding more features like transaction history or interest calculations.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "To examine a Java program that simulates a library management system, we can break down the components into three main classes: `Book`, `Member`, and `Loan`. Each class will have specific attributes and methods to manage the library's functionality effectively.\n\n### Class Definitions\n\n1. **Book Class**\n   - **Attributes**: \n     - `String title`\n     - `String author`\n     - `boolean isAvailable`\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `void addBook(String title, String author)`: Adds a new book to the library.\n     - `boolean checkAvailability()`: Returns true if the book is available for loan.\n     - `void markAsLoaned()`: Marks the book as loaned (sets `isAvailable` to false).\n     - `void markAsReturned()`: Marks the book as returned (sets `isAvailable` to true).\n\n   ```java\n   public class Book {\n       private String title;\n       private String author;\n       private boolean isAvailable;\n\n       public Book(String title, String author) {\n           this.title = title;\n           this.author = author;\n           this.isAvailable = true;\n       }\n\n       public boolean checkAvailability() {\n           return isAvailable;\n       }\n\n       public void markAsLoaned() {\n           isAvailable = false;\n       }\n\n       public void markAsReturned() {\n           isAvailable = true;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n2. **Member Class**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `String name`\n     - `int memberId`\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `void registerMember(String name, int memberId)`: Registers a new member.\n     - `int getMemberId()`: Returns the member's ID.\n\n   ```java\n   public class Member {\n       private String name;\n       private int memberId;\n\n       public Member(String name, int memberId) {\n           this.name = name;\n           this.memberId = memberId;\n       }\n\n       public int getMemberId() {\n           return memberId;\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n3. **Loan Class**\n   - **Attributes**:\n     - `Book book`\n     - `Member member`\n     - `LocalDate loanDate`\n     - `LocalDate dueDate`\n   - **Methods**:\n     - `void processLoan(Book book, Member member)`: Processes the loan of a book to a member.\n     - `void returnBook()`: Handles the return of a book and checks for overdue status.\n     - `boolean isOverdue()`: Checks if the book is overdue.\n\n   ```java\n   import java.time.LocalDate;\n\n   public class Loan {\n       private Book book;\n       private Member member;\n       private LocalDate loanDate;\n       private LocalDate dueDate;\n\n       public void processLoan(Book book, Member member) {\n           if (book.checkAvailability()) {\n               this.book = book;\n               this.member = member;\n               this.loanDate = LocalDate.now();\n               this.dueDate = loanDate.plusDays(14); // Assuming a 2-week loan period\n               book.markAsLoaned();\n           } else {\n               System.out.println(\"Book is not available for loan.\");\n           }\n       }\n\n       public void returnBook() {\n           if (book != null) {\n               if (isOverdue()) {\n                   System.out.println(\"Book is overdue. Please return it as soon as possible.\");\n               }\n               book.markAsReturned();\n               book = null; // Clear the loan\n               member = null;\n           }\n       }\n\n       public boolean isOverdue() {\n           return LocalDate.now().isAfter(dueDate);\n       }\n   }\n   ```\n\n### Example Usage\n\nHere\u2019s how you might use these classes in a simple library management system:\n\n```java\npublic class LibraryManagementSystem {\n   public static void main(String[] args) {\n       // Create books\n       Book book1 = new Book(\"1984\", \"George Orwell\");\n       Book book2 = new Book(\"To Kill a Mockingbird\", \"Harper Lee\");\n\n       // Register members\n       Member member1 = new Member(\"Alice\", 1);\n       Member member2 = new Member(\"Bob\", 2);\n\n       // Process loans\n       Loan loan = new Loan();\n       loan.processLoan(book1, member1); // Alice borrows 1984\n       System.out.println(\"Is '1984' available? \" + book1.checkAvailability()); // Should be false\n\n       // Return book\n       loan.returnBook(); // Alice returns 1984\n       System.out.println(\"Is '1984' available? \" + book1.checkAvailability()); // Should be true\n\n       // Edge case: Overdue book\n       loan.processLoan(book2, member2); // Bob borrows To Kill a Mockingbird\n       // Simulate overdue by not returning within 14 days\n       // Check overdue status\n       if (loan.isOverdue()) {\n           System.out.println(\"The book is overdue.\");\n       }\n   }\n}\n```\n\n### Edge Cases\n\n1. **Book Already Loaned**: Attempting to loan a book that is already loaned should return a message indicating unavailability.\n2. **Returning a Book Not Loaned**: Attempting to return a book that was not loaned should be handled gracefully.\n3. **Overdue Books**: When returning a book, if it is overdue, a warning message should be displayed.\n4. **Multiple Loans**: The system should handle multiple loans and ensure that each book can only be loaned to one member at a time.\n\nThis structure provides a basic framework for a library management system in Java, allowing for the addition of more features and complexity as needed.",
