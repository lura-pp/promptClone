    "H1_split_answer1": "**Question 1:** The benefits of meditation include reduced stress and anxiety, improved focus and concentration, enhanced emotional well-being, better self-awareness, and increased feelings of calm and relaxation. It can also promote better sleep and overall mental health.\n\n**Question 2:** To improve your time management skills, you can prioritize tasks using techniques like the Eisenhower Matrix, set specific goals, create a daily schedule, use tools like calendars and to-do lists, and limit distractions by setting boundaries for work and personal time.\n\n**Question 3:** Effective strategies for learning a new language include immersing yourself in the language through conversation and media, practicing regularly with native speakers, using language learning apps, setting achievable goals, and incorporating vocabulary and grammar exercises into your daily routine.",
    "H1_split_answer2": "# UnlimitedGPT \n#### Created by [Douwe] for the FlowGPT Hackathon S2 \nput an \u2018#\u2019 symbol between your questions to let chatGPT answer them at once.\n\n**Question 1:** Quantum computing is a type of computation that utilizes the principles of quantum mechanics to process information. Unlike classical computers that use bits as the smallest unit of data (which can be either 0 or 1), quantum computers use quantum bits, or qubits, which can exist in multiple states simultaneously due to superposition. This allows quantum computers to perform complex calculations at speeds unattainable by classical computers, making them particularly powerful for tasks such as cryptography, optimization, and simulating quantum systems.\n\n**Question 2:** The main differences between renewable and non-renewable energy sources are as follows: \n- **Renewable energy sources** are those that can be replenished naturally over a short period, such as solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal energy. They are generally more sustainable and have a lower environmental impact.\n- **Non-renewable energy sources**, on the other hand, are finite and will eventually deplete, such as fossil fuels (coal, oil, and natural gas) and nuclear energy. Their extraction and use often lead to environmental degradation and contribute to climate change.\n\n**Question 3:** Social media can impact mental health in various ways. On one hand, it can provide a sense of community, support, and connection, especially for individuals who may feel isolated. On the other hand, excessive use of social media can lead to negative outcomes such as anxiety, depression, and low self-esteem, often due to cyberbullying, social comparison, and the pressure to maintain a certain image. The impact varies from person to person, depending on their usage patterns and individual circumstances.",
