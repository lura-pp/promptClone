    "H1_split_answer1": "Your implementation of the `CollectionUtils` class with the `isEmpty` method looks good! It effectively checks if a given collection is either `null` or empty. Here\u2019s a brief breakdown of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Collection;\n\npublic class CollectionUtils {\n    public static boolean isEmpty(Collection<?> collection) {\n        return collection == null || collection.isEmpty();\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Class Declaration**: `public class CollectionUtils` defines a utility class that can contain static methods related to collections.\n- **Method Declaration**: `public static boolean isEmpty(Collection<?> collection)` defines a static method that can be called without creating an instance of `CollectionUtils`.\n- **Parameter**: The method takes a single parameter of type `Collection<?>`, which means it can accept any type of collection (e.g., `List`, `Set`).\n- **Return Statement**: The method returns `true` if the collection is `null` or if it is empty (i.e., `collection.isEmpty()` returns `true`).\n\n### Usage:\nYou can use this utility method in your code as follows:\n\n```java\nCollection<String> myCollection = null;\nif (CollectionUtils.isEmpty(myCollection)) {\n    System.out.println(\"The collection is empty or null.\");\n} else {\n    System.out.println(\"The collection has elements.\");\n}\n```\n\nThis utility class is helpful for avoiding `NullPointerExceptions` when working with collections.

    "H1_split_answer2": "Your implementation of the `CollectionChecker` class looks good! It provides a utility method to check if a given list is empty or null. Here\u2019s a brief breakdown of the code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class CollectionChecker {\n    public static boolean isCollectionEmpty(List<?> list) {\n        return list == null || list.size() == 0;\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Explanation:\n- **Class Declaration**: `public class CollectionChecker` defines a public class named `CollectionChecker`.\n- **Method Declaration**: `public static boolean isCollectionEmpty(List<?> list)` defines a static method that takes a `List` of any type (denoted by `<?>`) and returns a boolean.\n- **Null and Size Check**: The method checks if the list is `null` or if its size is `0`. If either condition is true, it returns `true`, indicating that the collection is empty.\n\n### Usage:\nYou can use this utility class in your Java application to easily check if a list is empty. Here\u2019s an example of how to use it:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.ArrayList;\nimport java.util.List;\n\npublic class Main {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        List<String> myList = new ArrayList<>();\n        \n        // Check if the list is empty\n        boolean isEmpty = CollectionChecker.isCollectionEmpty(myList);\n        System.out.println(\"Is the list empty? \" + isEmpty); // Output: Is the list empty? true\n        \n        myList.add(\"Hello\");\n        isEmpty = CollectionChecker.isCollectionEmpty(myList);\n        System.out.println(\"Is the list empty? \" + isEmpty); // Output: Is the list empty? false\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Considerations:\n- This method can be extended to check other types of collections (e.g., `Set`, `Map`) by overloading or using generics.\n- Ensure to import the necessary classes (`java.util.List`, etc.) when using this utility in your projects.\n\nIf you have any further questions or need additional functionality, feel free to ask!",
