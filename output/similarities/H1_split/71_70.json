    "H1_split_answer1": "To develop a Java application that addresses the parking challenge at your company campus, you can follow these steps:\n\n### 1. **Define the Project Scope**\n   - **Objective**: Create a real-time parking solution that identifies available parking spots using computer vision.\n   - **Key Features**:\n     - Access live camera feeds.\n     - Analyze the feeds to detect vacant parking spots.\n     - Display real-time updates on available spaces, including their specific numbers and locations.\n\n### 2. **Set Up the Development Environment**\n   - **Java Development Kit (JDK)**: Ensure you have the latest version of JDK installed.\n   - **IDE**: Use an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) like IntelliJ IDEA or Eclipse for Java development.\n   - **Libraries**: Include necessary libraries for computer vision, such as OpenCV.\n\n### 3. **Accessing Camera Feeds**\n   - Use Java libraries to access live camera feeds. You can use OpenCV's VideoCapture class to connect to the camera.\n   - Example code snippet to access a camera feed:\n     ```java\n     import org.opencv.core.Core;\n     import org.opencv.videoio.VideoCapture;\n\n     public class CameraAccess {\n         static { System.loadLibrary(Core.NATIVE_LIBRARY_NAME); }\n\n         public static void main(String[] args) {\n             VideoCapture camera = new VideoCapture(0); // 0 for default camera\n             if (camera.isOpened()) {\n                 // Process the camera feed\n             } else {\n                 System.out.println(\"Error: Camera not accessible.\");\n             }\n         }\n     }\n     ```\n\n### 4. **Implement Computer Vision for Spot Detection**\n   - Use image processing techniques to analyze the camera feed and detect parking spots.\n   - Techniques may include:\n     - Background subtraction to identify moving objects (cars).\n     - Contour detection to outline parking spaces.\n     - Color detection to differentiate between occupied and vacant spots.\n\n### 5. **Real-Time Updates and User Interface**\n   - Create a user interface (UI) to display the available parking spots.\n   - Use JavaFX or Swing for building the UI.\n   - Update the UI in real-time as the camera feed is processed.\n\n### 6. **Testing and Optimization**\n   - Test the application in different lighting conditions and parking scenarios.\n   - Optimize the computer vision algorithms for speed and accuracy.\n\n### 7. **Deployment**\n   - Deploy the application on a server or a local machine that has access to the camera feeds.\n   - Ensure that the application runs continuously to provide real-time updates.\n\n### 8. **Future Enhancements**\n   - Consider adding features like:\n     - Notifications for users when spots become available.\n     - Integration with a mobile app for easier access.\n     - Historical data analysis to predict peak parking times.\n\n### Example Code for Spot Detection (Pseudocode)\n```java\npublic void detectParkingSpots(Mat frame) {\n    // Convert frame to grayscale\n    Mat gray = new Mat();\n    Imgproc.cvtColor(frame, gray, Imgproc.COLOR_BGR2GRAY);\n\n    // Apply thresholding or edge detection\n    Mat edges = new Mat();\n    Imgproc.Canny(gray, edges, 100, 200);\n\n    // Find contours\n    List<MatOfPoint> contours = new ArrayList<>();\n    Mat hierarchy = new Mat();\n    Imgproc.findContours(edges, contours, hierarchy, Imgproc.RETR_TREE, Imgproc.CHAIN_APPROX_SIMPLE);\n\n    // Analyze contours to identify parking spots\n    for (MatOfPoint contour : contours) {\n        // Check if contour matches parking spot criteria\n        // If yes, mark as available or occupied\n    }\n}\n```\n\nBy following these steps, you can create a robust parking solution that leverages computer vision to help alleviate the parking challenges at your company campus.",
