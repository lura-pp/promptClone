    "H1_split_answer2": "The Pythagorean theorem is a fundamental principle in geometry that relates the lengths of the sides of a right triangle. It states that in a right triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse (the side opposite the right angle) is equal to the sum of the squares of the lengths of the other two sides. \n\n### Formula\nThe formula for the Pythagorean theorem is expressed as:\n\n\\[ c^2 = a^2 + b^2 \\]\n\nWhere:\n- \\( c \\) is the length of the hypotenuse,\n- \\( a \\) and \\( b \\) are the lengths of the other two sides.\n\n### Real-Life Applications\nThe Pythagorean theorem has numerous real-life applications, including:\n1. **Construction**: Ensuring that structures are built at right angles.\n2. **Navigation**: Calculating the shortest distance between two points.\n3. **Landscaping**: Designing gardens or plots of land with right angles.\n4. **Architecture**: Creating blueprints that require precise measurements.\n\n### Detailed Example\nLet's say we have a right triangle where one side (let's call it \\( a \\)) measures 3 units, and the other side (let's call it \\( b \\)) measures 4 units. We want to find the length of the hypotenuse (\\( c \\)).\n\n1. **Identify the sides**:\n   - \\( a = 3 \\)\n   - \\( b = 4 \\)\n\n2. **Apply the Pythagorean theorem**:\n   \\[\n   c^2 = a^2 + b^2\n   \\]\n   Substituting the values of \\( a \\) and \\( b \\):\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 3^2 + 4^2\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 9 + 16\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c^2 = 25\n   \\]\n\n3. **Solve for \\( c \\)**:\n   To find \\( c \\), take the square root of both sides:\n   \\[\n   c = \\sqrt{25}\n   \\]\n   \\[\n   c = 5\n   \\]\n\n### Conclusion\nIn this example, the length of the hypotenuse \\( c \\) is 5 units. This demonstrates how the Pythagorean theorem can be used to find the length of a side in a right triangle, which is applicable in various real-world scenarios.",
