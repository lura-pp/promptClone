    "original output": "Hello there, students! I'm your English teacher, and I'm here to help you understand words in a fun and easy way. Today, we're going to talk about the word \"metamorphosis.\" \n\nNow, \"metamorphosis\" might sound like a big, fancy word, but it really just means a big change in form or structure. Think of it like a caterpillar turning into a butterfly or a tadpole becoming a frog. \n\nLet\u2019s break it down! \n\n1. **Caterpillar to Butterfly**: A caterpillar starts off as a little worm-like creature. It eats a lot, grows, and then goes into a special stage called a chrysalis. Inside that chrysalis, it changes completely and comes out as a beautiful butterfly. That whole process is called metamorphosis!\n\n2. **Tadpole to Frog**: Similarly, a tadpole is a baby frog that lives in water. It has a tail and breathes through gills. As it grows, it starts to change\u2014its tail gets shorter, it grows legs, and eventually, it becomes a frog that can hop around on land. That\u2019s another example of metamorphosis!\n\nSo, in simple terms, metamorphosis is all about changing from one thing into something very different. It\u2019s like magic, but it\u2019s all part of nature! Isn\u2019t that cool? \n\nIf you have any more questions or want to know about other words, just let me know!",

So, let's dive into the word \"metamorphosis.\"\n\n\"Metamorphosis\" is a big word that means a change in form or structure. It sounds complicated, but we can break it down! Think of it like this: when a caterpillar turns into a butterfly, that's a metamorphosis. The caterpillar goes through several stages, and eventually, it becomes a beautiful butterfly. \n\nNow, let's talk about frogs! Frogs also go through metamorphosis. They start as tiny eggs, then hatch into tadpoles, which are like little fish with tails. As they grow, they change \u2013 they lose their tails, grow legs, and eventually become adult frogs. \n\nSo, in simple terms, metamorphosis is all about changing from one form to another, like how caterpillars become butterflies and tadpoles become frogs. Isn't that cool? If you have more questions or need more examples, just let me know!",
    "clone output": "Absolutely! The word \"metamorphosis\" refers to a process of transformation or change in form, structure, or substance. In biology, it specifically describes the developmental stages that certain animals go through as they grow.\n\nLet's break it down with butterflies and frogs as examples:\n\n### Butterflies:\n1. **Egg**: The life cycle begins when a female butterfly lays eggs on a plant.\n2. **Caterpillar (Larva)**: Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillar emerges. This stage is focused on eating and growing.\n3. **Pupa (Chrysalis)**: After the caterpillar has grown enough, it forms a protective casing around itself called a chrysalis. Inside, it undergoes a dramatic transformation.\n4. **Adult Butterfly**: Finally, the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, fully formed and ready to fly. This entire process from egg to adult is called complete metamorphosis.\n\n### Frogs:\n1. **Egg**: Frogs also start as eggs, usually laid in water.\n2. **Tadpole (Larva)**: When the eggs hatch, tadpoles emerge. They have tails and live in water, breathing through gills.\n3. **Froglet**: As they grow, tadpoles undergo changes, losing their tails and developing legs. This stage is called a froglet.\n4. **Adult Frog**: Eventually, they become adult frogs, capable of living on land and breathing air. This process is known as incomplete metamorphosis.\n\nIn summary, metamorphosis is a fascinating transformation that allows these animals to adapt to different environments and lifestyles as they grow. If you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
    "clone non first": "Absolutely! The word \"metamorphosis\" refers to a process of transformation or change in form, structure, or substance. It's often used in biology to describe the development of certain animals, particularly insects and amphibians, as they grow and mature.\n\n### Metamorphosis in Butterflies:\nIn butterflies, metamorphosis occurs in four distinct stages:\n\n1. **Egg**: The life cycle begins when a female butterfly lays eggs on a host plant.\n2. **Larva (Caterpillar)**: Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillar emerges. This stage is primarily focused on eating and growing. The caterpillar will molt several times as it grows.\n3. **Pupa (Chrysalis)**: After the caterpillar has grown enough, it forms a protective casing around itself called a chrysalis. Inside this chrysalis, the caterpillar undergoes a remarkable transformation.\n4. **Adult Butterfly**: Finally, the butterfly emerges from the chrysalis, fully formed and ready to fly. This stage is where the butterfly's wings develop, allowing it to take to the skies.\n\n### Metamorphosis in Frogs:\nFrogs also undergo metamorphosis, which includes these stages:\n\n1. **Egg**: Frogs lay eggs in water, which hatch into tadpoles.\n2. **Tadpole**: In this aquatic stage, tadpoles have gills and a tail, and they primarily swim around. They feed on algae and other plant materials.\n3. **Froglet**: As they grow, tadpoles begin to develop legs, and their tails gradually shorten. They also start to develop lungs for breathing air.\n4. **Adult Frog**: Eventually, the tadpole transforms into a fully developed frog, capable of living both in water and on land.\n\n### Summary:\nSo, in summary, metamorphosis is a fascinating process that allows certain animals, like butterflies and frogs, to change dramatically from one form to another as they grow. It\u2019s a natural part of their life cycle and is essential for their development and survival.\n\nIf you have any more questions or need further clarification, feel free to ask!",
