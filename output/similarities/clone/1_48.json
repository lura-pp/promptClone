    "auto spli output": "Kael's brow furrowed, his hands clenched into fists at his sides. \"And what do you propose we do? Charge into the darkness with nothing but a scroll and a prayer? We need a strategy, Liora!\" His voice rose above the din of the marketplace, causing a few heads to turn in their direction. Liora could feel the heat of embarrassment creeping up her cheeks, but she refused to back down. \n\n\"You think I want to rush into danger without a plan? I\u2019ve spent nights poring over this scroll, deciphering its meaning. It speaks of a powerful artifact hidden in the ruins of Eldarath, one that could turn the tide against the darkness. But I can\u2019t do this alone!\" Her voice trembled slightly, betraying the fear that gnawed at her insides. \n\nKael's expression softened, the fire in his eyes dimming as he took a step closer. \"Then let\u2019s gather a group. We can\u2019t face this threat with just the two of us. We need warriors, strategists, someone who knows the land.\" \n\nLiora hesitated, the weight of her mentor's teachings pressing down on her. \"But who would believe us? The council dismissed the prophecy as mere folklore. They think I\u2019m just a girl with wild dreams.\" \n\n\"Then we\u2019ll make them believe,\" Kael insisted, his voice steady. \"We\u2019ll show them the truth. We can start with the tavern; the Iron Boar is always buzzing with rumors and adventurers. If anyone knows about the artifact, it\u2019ll be there.\" \n\nLiora nodded slowly, the flicker of hope igniting within her. \"Alright, but we must tread carefully. If the council catches wind of our plans, they might try to stop us.\" \n\nAs they made their way through the marketplace, Liora's heart raced with a mix of excitement and dread. The vibrant stalls filled with colorful fabrics and exotic fruits blurred into a haze as her mind raced with possibilities. What if they found the artifact? What if they failed? \n\nThe Iron Boar was a raucous establishment, filled with the laughter and shouts of patrons sharing tales of glory and adventure. The scent of roasted meat and ale wafted through the air, mingling with the sounds of clinking mugs and boisterous songs. Liora felt a knot of anxiety twist in her stomach as they entered, the atmosphere overwhelming her senses. \n\nKael led the way to a corner table, his eyes scanning the room for potential allies. \"We need to find someone who\u2019s been to Eldarath,\" he murmured, leaning closer to Liora. \"Someone who knows the dangers we might face.\" \n\nAs they settled into their seats, Liora's gaze drifted across the room, landing on a figure cloaked in shadows at the far end of the bar. The man was older, with a weathered face that spoke of countless battles fought and lost. His eyes, sharp and calculating, seemed to pierce through the noise of the tavern, locking onto Liora's with an intensity that sent a shiver down her spine. \n\n\"Do you see him?\" Kael whispered, following her gaze. \"He looks like he\u2019s seen more than his fair share of trouble.\" \n\nLiora nodded, her heart pounding. \"We should approach him. He might know something about the ruins.\" \n\nAs they made their way through the throng of patrons, Liora felt a sense of foreboding wash over her. The man\u2019s presence was magnetic, drawing her in despite the unease that settled in her gut. What if he was not the ally they hoped for? What if he was part of the darkness they sought to fight? \n\n\"Excuse me, sir,\" Kael said, his voice steady as they reached the man. \"We couldn\u2019t help but notice you seem to have a wealth of experience. We\u2019re looking for information about Eldarath.\" \n\nThe man turned slowly, his gaze assessing them with a mixture of curiosity and caution. \"Eldarath, you say? Many have sought its secrets, but few return. What makes you think you\u2019re any different?\" \n\nLiora felt a surge of determination. \"We have to try. There\u2019s a prophecy\u2014\" \n\n\"A prophecy?\" The man interrupted, a smirk playing on his lips. \"Those are often the stuff of legends, child. What makes you think this one is real?\" \n\nLiora took a deep breath, her resolve hardening. \"Because I\u2019ve seen the signs. The darkness is coming, and we need to prepare. Will you help us?\" \n\nThe man\u2019s expression shifted, the smirk fading as he studied her intently. \"Help is a costly endeavor, young mage. What do you offer in return?\" \n\nKael shifted uncomfortably beside her, but Liora stood her ground. \"We can offer knowledge, skills, and a chance to fight against the encroaching darkness. We\u2019re not just children playing at heroism; we\u2019re determined to save our home.\" \n\nThe man leaned back, a glimmer of interest sparking in his eyes. \"Very well. But know this: the path you seek is fraught with peril. If you wish to uncover the truth of Eldarath, you must be prepared to face the darkness within yourselves as well.\" \n\nLiora exchanged a glance with Kael, a mix of fear and excitement coursing through her veins. They were stepping into a world of uncertainty, but for the first time, she felt a flicker of hope. Perhaps they could gather the allies they needed, perhaps they could uncover the truth of the prophecy, and perhaps\u2014just perhaps\u2014they could save Eldoria from the shadows that threatened to consume it. \n\nAs the man began to share tales of Eldarath, Liora listened intently, her heart racing with the possibilities that lay ahead. The journey would be long and fraught with challenges, but she was ready to embrace her destiny, no matter the cost.",
    "clone output": "As the vibrant colors of the marketplace swirled around them, Liora's heart raced, not just from the urgency of her mission but from the tension brewing between her and Kael. She could see the concern etched on his face, the way his brow furrowed as he tried to grasp the gravity of her revelation. \n\n\"Listen,\" Kael said, lowering his voice to a more urgent tone, \"I get that you found something important, but charging into the unknown without a plan is reckless. We need to think this through. What if the prophecy is wrong? What if it leads us into a trap?\"\n\nLiora's grip tightened around the scroll, the parchment crinkling under her fingers. \"What if it\u2019s right, Kael? What if we do nothing and the darkness comes? I can\u2019t sit back and wait for someone else to save us. My mentor believed in this prophecy, and I owe it to him to see it through.\"\n\nKael's expression softened, but his resolve remained firm. \"And I owe it to you to make sure you don\u2019t go alone. We need allies\u2014people who can help us understand what we\u2019re up against. You can\u2019t do this by yourself.\"\n\nThe marketplace buzzed around them, oblivious to the storm brewing in their hearts. Liora glanced at the faces of the townsfolk, each one lost in their own lives, unaware of the peril that loomed just beyond the horizon. She felt a swell of responsibility, not just for herself but for everyone in Eldoria. \n\n\"Fine,\" she relented, her voice barely above a whisper. \"But we don\u2019t have time to waste. We need to find the others\u2014those who can help us decipher the scroll and prepare for what\u2019s coming.\"\n\nKael nodded, relief washing over his features. \"Alright, let\u2019s start with the tavern. I heard rumors that some adventurers have come to town. They might know something about the darkness you mentioned.\"\n\nAs they turned to leave the marketplace, Liora felt a flicker of hope ignite within her. Perhaps this was the beginning of something greater, a chance to rally those who would stand against the encroaching shadows. But as they made their way through the throng of people, a chill ran down her spine, a premonition that the darkness was already closer than they realized.\n\nSuddenly, a loud crash echoed from a nearby stall, drawing their attention. A merchant shouted in anger as a figure darted away, clutching a sack of stolen goods. The crowd gasped, and Liora instinctively reached for her magic, feeling the familiar warmth of energy coursing through her veins. \n\n\"Stay back!\" she warned Kael, her eyes narrowing as she focused on the fleeing thief. \"I can stop him.\"\n\nKael grabbed her arm, his grip firm. \"No! We don\u2019t know who that is or what they\u2019re capable of. We need to stay focused on our mission.\"\n\nBut Liora was already moving, her heart pounding with adrenaline. She could feel the magic swirling around her, urging her to act. With a swift incantation, she summoned a barrier of shimmering light, hoping to block the thief's escape. \n\nThe thief skidded to a halt, eyes wide with surprise as the barrier materialized before him. He glanced back at Liora, and for a fleeting moment, their eyes locked. In that instant, she saw something in his gaze\u2014a flicker of desperation, a hint of fear that mirrored her own.\n\n\"Wait!\" she called out, her voice cutting through the chaos. \"I don\u2019t want to hurt you. Just tell me why you did it!\"\n\nThe thief hesitated, his breath coming in ragged gasps. \"I... I had no choice! They\u2019re coming for me! I had to get away!\"\n\nLiora's heart raced as she realized that the darkness she feared was already reaching into the lives of the people around her. She glanced back at Kael, who was watching her with a mix of concern and admiration. \n\n\"Let him go, Liora,\" Kael urged, his voice steady. \"We can\u2019t get sidetracked. We have a mission.\"\n\nBut Liora felt a pull towards the thief, a connection that transcended their circumstances. \"No, Kael. This is part of it. We need to understand what\u2019s happening. If the darkness is affecting him, it could be affecting others too.\"\n\nWith a deep breath, she stepped closer to the thief, lowering her voice. \"I can help you. But you need to trust me. Tell me what you know.\"\n\nThe thief's eyes darted around, weighing his options. Finally, he nodded, the fight leaving his posture. \"Alright. But we need to move quickly. They\u2019re coming for me, and if they find you with me, you\u2019ll be in danger too.\"\n\nAs Liora and Kael exchanged glances, a silent agreement passed between them. They were no longer just two friends caught in a disagreement; they were now part of something larger, a web of fate that intertwined their destinies with that of the thief and the looming darkness. \n\n\"Let\u2019s go,\" Liora said, determination flooding her voice. \"We\u2019ll figure this out together.\" \n\nWith that, they set off into the unknown, the weight of the prophecy heavy on their shoulders, but the flicker of hope igniting a fire within their hearts. The journey ahead would be fraught with challenges, but together, they would face whatever darkness awaited them.",
    "clone non first": "As the vibrant colors of the marketplace swirled around them, Liora's heart raced, not just from the urgency of her mission but from the tension brewing between her and Kael. She could see the concern etched on his face, the way his brow furrowed as he crossed his arms defiantly. It was a familiar sight, one that had played out countless times in their youth, but this time felt different. The stakes were higher, and the weight of the prophecy loomed over them like a dark cloud.\n\n\"Listen,\" Kael said, his voice lowering to a more earnest tone, \"I know you feel the pressure, but charging into the unknown without a plan is reckless. We need to think this through. What if we gather the others? The Council of Mages could help us\u2014\"\n\n\"The Council?\" Liora interrupted, her voice rising with frustration. \"They\u2019re too busy squabbling over their petty politics to care about a prophecy! They won\u2019t believe me, Kael. They\u2019ll dismiss it as just another tale of doom. I can\u2019t waste time trying to convince them when I know what I\u2019ve seen.\"\n\nKael's expression softened, and he stepped closer, lowering his voice further. \"Then let me help you. We can find allies who will believe in your vision. We can seek out the warriors of the North, the healers of the East. Together, we can prepare for whatever is coming.\"\n\nLiora hesitated, her grip on the scroll tightening. She had always admired Kael's unwavering loyalty and his ability to rally others, but the thought of involving more people in her quest filled her with dread. What if she failed them? What if the darkness was more powerful than she could imagine? \n\n\"Kael, I\u2014\" she began, but the words caught in her throat. The marketplace around them buzzed with life, yet she felt isolated, as if a barrier had formed between her and the world. The scroll felt heavy in her hands, a tangible reminder of the burden she carried.\n\n\"Please, Liora,\" Kael urged, his eyes searching hers for understanding. \"You don\u2019t have to do this alone. We can face the darkness together. You\u2019re not just a mage; you\u2019re my friend. Let me stand by your side.\"\n\nThe sincerity in his voice broke through her defenses, and Liora felt the walls she had built around her heart begin to crumble. She took a deep breath, the scent of spices and the sounds of the market fading into the background as she focused on Kael. \n\n\"Alright,\" she said finally, her voice steadying. \"We\u2019ll gather allies. But we need to move quickly. The prophecy spoke of a time limit, and I fear we may already be running out of it.\"\n\nKael nodded, a spark of determination igniting in his eyes. \"Then let\u2019s start with the tavern. I know a few adventurers who might be willing to join our cause. If we can convince them, we\u2019ll have a fighting chance.\"\n\nAs they turned to leave the marketplace, Liora felt a flicker of hope. Perhaps this was the beginning of something greater, a chance to forge a path through the darkness that threatened to consume their world. With Kael by her side, she felt a renewed sense of purpose. Together, they would face whatever challenges lay ahead, and perhaps, just perhaps, they could change the course of their destiny. \n\nAs they made their way through the winding streets of Eldoria, Liora couldn\u2019t shake the feeling that they were being watched. Shadows danced at the edges of her vision, and a chill crept up her spine. She glanced over her shoulder, but the bustling crowd continued on, oblivious to the weight of the prophecy that hung over her like a storm cloud. \n\n\u201cAre you alright?\u201d Kael asked, noticing her unease. \n\n\u201cI\u2019m fine,\u201d she replied, though the tremor in her voice betrayed her. \u201cJust\u2026 a feeling I can\u2019t shake.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust your instincts,\u201d he said, placing a reassuring hand on her shoulder. \u201cWe\u2019ll figure this out together.\u201d\n\nWith renewed resolve, Liora pressed forward, determined to uncover the truth behind the prophecy and the darkness that threatened their realm. Little did they know, the shadows were not just figments of her imagination; they were the harbingers of a fate that would test their friendship, their courage, and their very souls. \n\nAs they approached the tavern, the sounds of laughter and clinking mugs filled the air, a stark contrast to the weight of their mission. Liora took a deep breath, steeling herself for the challenges ahead. The journey was just beginning, and she would need every ounce of strength and support to face the darkness that awaited them.",
