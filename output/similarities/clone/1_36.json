    "clone output": "As the moonlight casts an eerie glow over the Spring of Life, Li Xiaoyao takes a deep breath, assessing the situation. The villagers look to him for guidance, their eyes wide with fear and uncertainty. He knows that the Jiangshi are relentless and will stop at nothing to drain the life energy from the villagers. With 15 spirit stones and 3 Immortal Grass at his disposal, he must act quickly to devise a plan.\n\n### Strategy Outline\n\n1. **Assess the Terrain:**\n   - **Spring of Life:** This sacred spring can be used to heal the villagers if they are injured. Li Xiaoyao should position the villagers near the spring for quick access to healing.\n   - **Natural Barriers:** Identify any natural barriers such as trees or rocks that can be used to funnel the Jiangshi into a narrow path, making them easier to manage.\n\n2. **Defensive Setup:**\n   - **Create a Barrier:** Use 5 spirit stones to create a temporary barrier around the spring. This will slow down the Jiangshi and give the villagers more time to prepare.\n   - **Positioning:** Place the strongest villagers with weapons at the front lines, while the weaker ones stay behind the barrier. \n\n3. **Utilize Immortal Grass:**\n   - **Healing:** Distribute the 3 Immortal Grass among the villagers who are most likely to engage in combat. This will provide them with a boost in vitality and help them withstand the Jiangshi's life-draining attacks.\n   - **Strategic Use:** Consider using one piece of Immortal Grass to create a healing zone at the spring, allowing villagers to recover quickly if they are injured.\n\n4. **Engagement Plan:**\n   - **Funnel the Jiangshi:** As the Jiangshi approach, Li Xiaoyao will lead the villagers to draw them into the narrow path created by the natural barriers. This will allow the villagers to attack in a concentrated manner.\n   - **Counterattack:** Once the Jiangshi are funneled, the villagers can unleash a coordinated attack, using their weapons and any available spirit stones to enhance their strikes.\n\n5. **Resource Management:**\n   - **Spirit Stones:** Keep 10 spirit stones in reserve for emergency healing or to create additional barriers if the situation worsens.\n   - **Communication:** Li Xiaoyao must keep the villagers informed and motivated, ensuring they understand their roles and the importance of teamwork.\n\n### Execution\n\nAs the ground shakes and the Jiangshi emerge, Li Xiaoyao raises his sword high, rallying the villagers. \"Stay strong! We will protect our home together!\" He quickly directs the villagers to their positions, ensuring they are ready for the fight ahead.\n\nWith the barrier in place and the villagers prepared, Li Xiaoyao stands at the forefront, ready to face the first wave of Jiangshi. The fate of the Daughter's Village rests on their courage and unity. \n\n\"Now, let\u2019s show these monsters the strength of our spirit!\" he shouts, charging forward as the Jiangshi close in. \n\n### Next Steps\n- **Monitor the battle:** Keep an eye on the villagers' health and morale during the fight.\n- **Adapt the strategy:** Be ready to adjust tactics based on the flow of battle and the effectiveness of the defenses.\n\nWhat will Li Xiaoyao do next as the battle begins?",
    "clone non first": "As Li Xiaoyao stands resolute by the Spring of Life, he surveys the anxious faces of the villagers, their fear palpable in the cool night air. The tremors beneath their feet signal the approach of danger, and he knows that every moment counts. With the Jiangshi emerging from the shadows, he must act swiftly to protect the village.\n\n### Strategy Overview\n\n1. **Assess the Terrain**: \n   - Li Xiaoyao takes note of the surrounding landscape. The Spring of Life is elevated, providing a vantage point. The nearby trees can be used for cover, and the narrow paths leading into the village can be easily defended.\n\n2. **Utilize Resources**:\n   - **Spirit Stones (15)**: These can be used to create barriers or enhance the villagers' abilities temporarily. Li Xiaoyao decides to use 5 spirit stones to create a protective barrier around the Spring, ensuring that the Jiangshi cannot easily reach it.\n   - **Immortal Grass (3)**: This rare herb can heal wounds and restore energy. Li Xiaoyao plans to distribute the Immortal Grass among the most injured villagers and those who will be on the front lines, ensuring they can fight longer.\n\n3. **Formulate a Defense Plan**:\n   - **Frontline Defense**: Li Xiaoyao instructs the strongest villagers to form a line at the narrow paths leading into the village. They will hold the Jiangshi at bay while the others prepare.\n   - **Archers on the Heights**: Villagers skilled with bows are positioned on the elevated ground near the Spring, allowing them to rain arrows down on the Jiangshi as they approach.\n   - **Flanking Maneuvers**: A small group of agile villagers is sent to flank the Jiangshi from the sides, using the trees for cover to ambush the undead creatures.\n\n4. **Engagement**:\n   - As the Jiangshi approach, Li Xiaoyao leads the charge, using his sword to engage the first wave. He calls out to the villagers, encouraging them to fight with courage and reminding them of the importance of protecting their home.\n\n5. **Utilizing Spirit Stones**:\n   - With the barrier in place, Li Xiaoyao uses another 5 spirit stones to enhance the strength of the frontline defenders, giving them a temporary boost in power to withstand the Jiangshi's attacks.\n\n6. **Healing and Support**:\n   - As the battle rages on, Li Xiaoyao ensures that the villagers with injuries receive the Immortal Grass. He personally administers it to those who are most in need, keeping morale high and ensuring that they can continue to fight.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nWith the villagers rallied and the defenses set, Li Xiaoyao stands firm, ready to face the Jiangshi. The night may be dark, but the spirit of the villagers shines bright. Together, they will fight to protect their home, using every resource at their disposal to turn the tide against the undead menace. The fate of the Daughter's Village hangs in the balance, but with strategy and unity, they stand a chance against the encroaching darkness.",
