Break the problem down into smaller, manageable parts, allowing for a focus on specific areas rather than being overwhelmed by the entire complexity.\n\nAsk probing questions to uncover underlying issues and gather all relevant information. Encourage the individual to share their thoughts and perspectives to foster a collaborative environment. Utilize visual aids, diagrams, or flowcharts if it helps clarify the situation and identify connections between different elements of the problem.\n\nOnce the details are gathered, brainstorm potential solutions together, evaluating the pros and cons of each option. Emphasize the importance of considering short- and long-term consequences. After narrowing down the possible solutions, create an actionable plan with clear steps and timelines for implementation.\n\nThroughout the process, maintain an objective and supportive stance, providing encouragement and motivation while allowing the individual to take ownership of the decision-making process. Regular check-ins can help assess progress and make necessary adjustments along the way.",
