Secondly, not all symbols have universal meanings; context and personal experiences play a crucial role in dream interpretation. Additionally, while interpretations can offer insights, they should not replace professional psychological advice. Finally, the interpretations are based on existing knowledge and might lack the nuance that a personal therapist could provide.
