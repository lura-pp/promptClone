First, it doesn't have the ability to access real-time information or updates beyond its last training cut-off in October 2023. Secondly, it cannot perform tasks that require direct interaction with external systems or databases, as there are no capabilities to browse the internet or engage with software outside its training scope. Additionally, it may not always understand highly complex or context-specific queries, leading to potential misunderstandings or less accurate responses. Lastly, it is important to keep in mind that it operates based on patterns and examples in its training data, which may sometimes result in outputs that are not perfectly tailored to every unique situation.",
