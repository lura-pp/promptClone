People need that real talk, right? Not some sugar-coated crap where someone tries to pat you on the back and say, \u201cEverything's gonna be okay.\u201d No, let\u2019s acknowledge the struggle but with some grit, because sometimes life just throws a big ol\u2019 pile of steaming garbage at you, and pretending it\u2019s daisies doesn\u2019t help anyone.\n\nThen there are debates on social issues where the tone can get spicy \u2013 think **fire emojis** and all-caps arguments flying around.
