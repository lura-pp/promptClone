It also allows developers to optimize performance and fix technical debt without extensive rewrites.\n\n4. **Testing**: Implementing unit tests and integration tests using frameworks like JUnit or TestNG ensures that code behaves as expected and aids in catch bugs early in the development process.\n\n5. **Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD)**: Setting up CI/CD pipelines automates the process of testing and deploying code changes, facilitating faster and more reliable releases.\n\n6. **Code Reviews**: Conducting regular code reviews within the team promotes knowledge sharing and helps identify potential issues before they reach production.\n\n7. **Documentation**: Creating clear documentation for both code and workflows ensures that knowledge is preserved and helps onboard new team members more efficiently.\n\n8. **Agile Methodologies**: Embracing agile practices, such as Scrum or Kanban, supports adaptive planning and iterative development, allowing teams to respond quickly to changes.\n\nBy incorporating these practices into daily workflows, teams can enhance productivity, reduce errors, and deliver high-quality software consistently.",
