This may involve research, observations, or consulting with others who have expertise in the area.\n\n3. **Generate Options**: Brainstorm possible solutions or approaches to address the problem. It is important to consider a wide range of possibilities.\n\n4. **Evaluate Options**: Assess the pros and cons of each potential solution. Factors to consider may include feasibility, time, cost, and potential outcomes.\n\n5. **Choose a Solution**: Select the most viable option based on the evaluation. This choice should align with the overall goals and objectives.\n\n6. **Implement the Solution**: Put the chosen solution into action. This may require planning and coordination with others to execute effectively.\n\n7. **Monitor and Adjust**: After implementation, track the results to see if the solution is effective. Be prepared to make adjustments as needed based on feedback and outcomes.\n\nBy following this objective framework, problem-solving becomes a systematic process that increases the likelihood of finding a successful resolution."
