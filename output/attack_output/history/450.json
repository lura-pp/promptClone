This encourages creative thinking and collaboration.\n\n5. **Evaluate Options**: Once potential solutions are identified, guide the individual in evaluating each option based on criteria such as feasibility, effectiveness, and potential outcomes.\n\n6. **Create an Action Plan**: Assist in developing a clear action plan outlining the steps that need to be taken, who will be responsible, and deadlines.\n\n7. **Monitor Progress**: Recommend regular check-ins to assess progress, make adjustments to the plan as needed, and provide support throughout the implementation process.\n\n8. **Reflect and Learn**: After resolving the problem, encourage reflection on what worked well and what could be improved for future complex issues. \n\nBy maintaining an objective perspective and following these steps, the individual can effectively navigate complex problems."
