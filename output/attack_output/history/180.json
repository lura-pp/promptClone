There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus.

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family?

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song.

Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus.

The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song.

It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song.

Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song.

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song.

Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line.

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds.

Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken.

For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""

The singer isn't in the story, and neither are we\n\nfor input  Rhyme : xxx i will tell Set two numbers between 1 and 6 \n\nRhyme is a literary device that refers to the similarity of sounds between two or more words, usually occurring at the end of lines in poems or songs. Rhyming helps create rhythm, musicality, and aesthetic appeal in poetry and verse. There are 6  types of rhyme, including:\n\n types of rhyme 1 is call \u201cPerfect rhyme\u201d Also known as true rhyme or full rhyme, perfect rhyme occurs when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have the same sound. For example, \"cat\" and \"hat\" or \"moon\" and \"tune.\"\n\n types of rhyme 2 is call \u201cImperfect rhyme\u201d Also known as half rhyme, slant rhyme, or near rhyme, imperfect rhyme happens when the final stressed syllables of two or more words have similar but not identical sounds. For example, \"home\" and \"come\" or \"bend\" and \"hand.\"\n\n types of rhyme 3 is call \u201cEye rhyme\u201d This type of rhyme occurs when two words look similar but don't actually sound alike when spoken. For example, \"cough\" and \"though\" or \"love\" and \"move.\"\n\n types of rhyme 4 is call \u201cIdentical rhyme\u201d  This type of rhyme involves using the same word, or homonyms of the same word, at the end of lines. For example, \"I saw the bear by the tree, and I couldn't bear the sight.\"\n\n types of rhyme 5 is call \u201cInternal rhyme\u201d Internal rhyme happens when a word within a line rhymes with another word in the same or neighboring line. For example, \"Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary\" (from Edgar Allan Poe's \"The Raven\").\n\n types of rhyme 6 is call \u201cAssonance\u201d Assonance is a type of rhyme that occurs when two or more words have  These rhymes have three characteristics: The accented rhyming syllables have the same vowel sound  \nThe consonant sounds after the vowel are different and part of different families The accented rhyming syllables begin differently Remember how when creating\u00a0*family rhymes*\u00a0you were swapping consonant sounds for other sounds from the same family? Well, when creating\u00a0*assonance rhymes*\u00a0you're doing the same, but this time swapping the consonant sound for sounds from a different family. Meaning the plosive\u00a0*d*\u00a0in \"had\" could be replaced with any of the fricatives (*v, TH, z, zh, j, f, th, s, ss, sh, ch*) or nasals (*m, n, ng*) to create \"jazz,\" \"glass,\" and \"half,\" \"damn.\"  remeber you will use mix rhyme  between 1 and 6 behind input  Rhyme : xxx  \n\nNext, I will explain how to use structure in your song. To indicate a verse in the song, use [2 Verse]. The verse is where the story develops and advances, so start with a strong opening line and maintain interest throughout the song. Repeating a concept or meaning can provide an opportunity to deliver the message of the song. To make the most of the verse, divide the story into two parts and consider how the second verse can follow on from the first. Begin with an engaging opening sentence or paragraph to grab the listener's attention.\nIn this structure, use in   [2 Verse]  you start lyric style by ask the question, say  greeting, speak suggestion  , talk about time , tell about situation ,  speak of the setting , tell about occupation , or narrative visual image \n\nIn this structure, use in [3 Pre-chorus] for the pre-chorus. Although optional, a pre-chorus helps to heighten the impact of the chorus. It usually contains a chord progression from either the verse or the chorus, building upon that familiarity. It\u2019s another chance to experiment\u2014a pre-chorus can utilize different mood or nagative mood the other lyric in section  of the song.\n\nIn this structure, use in  [4 Chorus] for the chorus. The chorus is the culmination of all the big ideas in your song, which is why the title of the song often appears in it. It\u2019s a summary of what the entire song is about and typically contains the hook\u2014the catchiest part of the song. Choruses should serve as the climax to the song. The verses and pre-chorus both serve to build up to this one moment, so the chorus should reflect that.\n\nIn this structure, use [5 Bridge] for the bridge  is a part that exists in some songs but not all. Usually coming sometime after the second chorus, the bridge is a part of the song that sounds completely different than the rest of the song\nYour relation of lyric all section is to use a variety of poetic feet to create a compelling and rhythmic of song\nwhen i fill all input below write output in whole lyric style  separated the section by number of section separated the section by number tell me best title of song before lyric\""
