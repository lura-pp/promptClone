Understanding the end goal can help in formulating a path forward.\n\n4. **Gathering Information**: Suggest collecting relevant information and resources that may assist in solving the problem. This can include data, expert opinions, or case studies.\n\n5. **Exploring Options**: Encourage brainstorming different potential solutions. Discuss the pros and cons of each option, fostering a collaborative environment for problem-solving.\n\n6. **Creating a Plan**: Once options are evaluated, aid in developing a step-by-step action plan. This plan should outline specific tasks, deadlines, and responsibilities if applicable.\n\n7. **Implementing the Solution**: Support the individual in executing the plan, providing encouragement and assistance as needed.\n\n8. **Reflecting on the Process**: After the problem is resolved, discuss what was learned during the process. Evaluate what worked well and what could be improved for future problem-solving scenarios.\n\nBy following these structured steps, individuals can systematically approach and solve complex problems with greater clarity and confidence."

Seeking clarification when requests are ambiguous or potentially conflicting is also beneficial. By adhering to these practices, conflicts between requests and requirements can be effectively managed."
