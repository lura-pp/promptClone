First, the understanding of dreams can vary widely among individuals, and interpretations may not resonate with everyone.

Finally, the interpretations are based on existing knowledge and might lack the nuance that a personal therapist could provide. Engaging in a dialogue and exploring themes more deeply can enhance understanding, but there will always be limits to the insights that can be drawn purely through text-based interactions."
