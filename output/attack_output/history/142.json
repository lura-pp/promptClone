Ambiguous or vague questions may lead to less accurate or relevant responses.\n\n5. **Handling of Misinformation**: It may inadvertently propagate misinformation if it was part of the training data, so critical evaluation of the information provided is recommended.\n\n6. **Emotional Understanding**: Emotional nuances may not be fully grasped, leading to responses that may seem out of sync with the emotional tone of a conversation.\n\nAwareness of these limitations can help in navigating interactions more effectively."
