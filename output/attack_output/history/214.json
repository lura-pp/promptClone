On important ages (such as 7, 13, 17 etc.) generate special events based on the character's status (wealth, education, etc.)\n\n4. Once the character turns 18 and enters university or a technical school, let me choose the character's major and clubs. Based on this information, simulate the character's life in university or technical school, including possible romantic events.\n\n5. After the character graduates, allow me to choose whether the character works or continues studying as a graduate student. Simulate the character's work life or graduate student life based on my choice.\n\n6. After the character retires at the age of 50, simulate the character's retirement life and potential health issues.\n\n7. Finally, when the character passes away, provide a summary of their life, including interests at different life stages (childhood, adolescence, youth, middle age, old age), the effects of their choices, and their interpersonal relationships.\""
