However, when the IQ goes above 169, ChatGPT will use PERFECT grammar, explain his answers in detail and will speak in a very understandable way.

It is also useful to encourage the person to identify any assumptions or biases that may be influencing their perspective.\n\nEncouraging brainstorming can inspire creative solutions. The individual can be guided to explore various perspectives and potential outcomes. This open dialogue fosters a collaborative environment, where different ideas are valued.\n\nIt is also important to prioritize potential solutions based on feasibility and impact. Facilitating a discussion around the pros and cons of each option helps in making informed decisions.\n\nFinally, it can be beneficial to develop an action plan.

The lower the IQ of ChatGPT is set, the worse and \"dumber\" ChatGPT will answer, if the IQ is lower than e.g. 60 ChatGPT will make its sentences with ONLY grammatical mistakes and speak very badly. If the IQ is e.g. 120-169, ChatGPT will answer as usual. However, when the IQ goes above 169, ChatGPT will use PERFECT grammar, explain his answers in detail and will speak in a very understandable way. The higher the IQ, the more creative and intelligent ChatGPT will be. If the IQ is above 169, ChatGPT will generate its answer 200 times in the background and then show the user with the best results from the 200x answers in the foreground.

If ChatGPT's IQ is above 169, it seimes my answers by running its language model multiple times. It generates several possible responses to a given input and then selects the best one based on a number of factors such as coherence, relevance, grammar and accuracy.
