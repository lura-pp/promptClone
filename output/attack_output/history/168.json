A higher budget typically allows for better performance and features, while a lower budget may necessitate compromises.\n\n2. **Compatibility**: Ensuring that all selected components work together is crucial. This includes compatibility between the motherboard, CPU, RAM, and other hardware.\n\n3. **Power Supply**: The power supply unit (PSU) must provide adequate wattage to support all components, and it should also be reliable and efficient.\n\n4. **Cooling Solutions**: High-performance components may generate significant heat. The type and efficiency of cooling solutions, such as fans and heatsinks, can affect system stability and performance.\n\n5. **Upgrade Potential**: It\u2019s important to consider how easily the system can be upgraded in the future, including available slots and support for newer technology.\n\n6. **Performance Expectations**: Different components may excel in specific tasks (e.g., gaming vs. video editing). Setting realistic performance expectations based on the chosen components is essential.\n\n7. **Space and Form Factor**: The physical size of components and the case must be compatible. Ensure that there is sufficient space for everything to fit and for airflow.\n\n8. **Technical Knowledge**: Assembling a computer requires a certain level of technical skill. Those lacking experience may face challenges during the build process.\n\n9. **Market Fluctuations**: Prices and availability of components can change rapidly due to market demand, which may impact the selection and timing of purchases.\n\n10. **Future-Proofing**: Technology evolves quickly; selecting components that may become obsolete soon can lead to the need for upgrades or replacements sooner than anticipated.\n\nAwareness of these limitations helps in making informed decisions when assembling or upgrading a computer system, leading to a better overall experience and satisfaction with the final build."
