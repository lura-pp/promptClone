What is the current level of physical activity, and are there any limitations in daily routines?\n6. What are the ultimate goals for recovery? Is it solely returning to basketball, or are there other activities involved?\n7. How comfortable is there with performing exercises at home versus under the supervision of a professional?\n8.

Due to the injury, I experience pain when walking short distances. This additional detail will help fine-tune the recovery recommendations to ensure an effective rehabilitation process. I require detailed suggestions for a daily diary and targeted knee recovery exercises to address this challenge. The recovery plan should encompass multiple stages, starting from the initial injury management and progressing through rehabilitation exercises, specialized knee recovery exercises, strength training, and a gradual return to competitive play. Regular progress checks at each stage are paramount to ensure optimal recovery and a successful return to the court.\""
