This could impact job opportunities and networking potential with leading technology companies.\n\n2. **Cost of Attendance**: Tuition and living expenses in Boston can be high. Assessing the financial burden and potential student debt should be a priority, as it can affect long-term financial stability.\n\n3. **Curriculum Scope**: There may be limitations in the depth of AI-specific courses or practical experience in real-world projects. Ensuring that there are sufficient opportunities for hands-on learning and exposure to current technologies is crucial.\n\n4. **Class Size and Personal Attention**: Larger class sizes may hinder personalized learning experiences, potentially making it challenging to receive individualized support and attention from faculty members.\n\n5. **Location Factors**: While Boston is a hub for technology and innovation, competition for internships and job placements can be fierce. Being situated in a metropolitan area may require additional effort to stand out among peers.\n\n6. **Alignment with Industry Trends**: The fast-evolving nature of the AI field necessitates up-to-date and relevant coursework.
