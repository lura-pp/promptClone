Here, the current state of soft matter informatics is discussed. Challenges specific to soft materials, including data classification, various degrees of organization at multiple length scales, and process-dependent properties require unique approaches by researchers in order to develop robust informatics approaches in soft matter. The current ability to extract and analyze the information from the PoLyInfo database is demonstrated by the fitting of the Flory\u2013Fox equation for glass transition temperature for several polymers.
