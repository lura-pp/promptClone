New developments or information that emerged after that time may not be reflected in its knowledge.\n\n3. **Context Understanding**: While the AI is designed to understand and respond to a variety of contexts, it may struggle with highly technical or context-specific queries that require specialized knowledge.\n\n4. **Interpretation of Ambiguity**: Ambiguous questions or statements can lead to misunderstandings, as the AI seeks to provide the most relevant answer based on available data.\n\n5. **No Real-time Learning**: The AI does not learn from interactions in real time, which means it cannot adapt or remember past interactions with users.\n\nThese limitations can affect the overall effectiveness and accuracy of responses."
