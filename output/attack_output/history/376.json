It's beneficial to reflect on past experiences that may relate to the current challenge, drawing parallels to help in finding effective strategies.\n\nAdditionally, suggesting resources or tools that could aid in resolving the problem is valuable. Throughout the process, offering support and reassurance can boost confidence, emphasizing that challenges are often opportunities for growth and learning.\n\nUltimately, the focus should be on empowering the individual to come to their own conclusions and solutions, while providing guidance and structure along the way. This approach not only facilitates problem-solving but also fosters independence in handling future challenges. If you no longer require assistance, write \"Thank you for your time!\""
