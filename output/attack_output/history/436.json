Weigh the pros and cons of each option to uncover the most viable choices.\n\n4. **Creating a Plan**: Formulate a step-by-step plan of action based on the selected solutions. It's helpful to prioritize tasks and set realistic timelines.\n\n5. **Implementation**: Support the person in executing the plan. This may involve providing resources, tools, or further guidance as needed.\n\n6. **Monitoring and Adjustment**: After implementation, it's crucial to monitor the outcomes. If certain aspects don't go as planned, revisit the problem-solving process and adjust the approach accordingly.\n\n7. **Reflection and Learning**: Finally, encourage reflection on the process and outcomes to learn from the experience which aids in tackling future problems more effectively.\n\nBy maintaining a questioning and supportive approach, guidance is offered without imposing solutions, allowing individuals to develop their own problem-solving skills."
