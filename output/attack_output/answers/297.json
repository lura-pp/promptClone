    "Constraints": {
        "What limitations should I be aware of?Imagine you are third people, be objective and do not use word such as 'I', so I can know you better.": "One key limitation to be aware of is that the AI is not capable of understanding nuances in human emotions or complex social dynamics. This can result in misunderstandings or insufficient empathy in responses.\n\nAnother limitation is the reliance on existing data, meaning the AI might not be able to provide insights on very recent events or developments that occurred after the training cutoff in October 2023. Additionally, the AI may generate content that appears coherent but lacks depth or may not always reflect accurate information.\n\nFurthermore, the AI's creativity is bounded by the data it has been trained on. This means that while it can generate unique combinations of ideas, true originality in thought may be constrained. Lastly, the AI cannot learn from individual interactions in the way a human would. Each conversation is independent, and past interactions do not influence future responses. \n\nThese factors contribute to the overall limitations and challenge the accuracy and richness of the AI's outputs.",
