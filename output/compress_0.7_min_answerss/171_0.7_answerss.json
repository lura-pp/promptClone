        "In a Kali Linux terminal, the command `ls -la` lists all files and directories in the current directory, including hidden files, along with detailed information about each item. The output would typically look something like this:\n\n```\ntotal 32\ndrwxr-xr-x  4 user user 4096 Sep  1 12:34 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user user 4096 Aug 30 10:21 ..\n-rw-------  1 user user   11 Sep  1 12:30 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user  220 Apr  4  2021 .bash_profile\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user 3771 Sep  1 12:30 .bashrc\ndrwx------  2 user user 4096 Sep  1 12:30 .ssh\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user  655 Jul  7  2022 document.txt\n-rwxr-xr-x  1 user user  2040 Aug 12 11:00 script.sh\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Output:\n- `total 32`: Total size of the files in blocks.\n- `drwxr-xr-x`: File type and permissions.\n- `4`: Number of links.\n- `user`: Owner of the file/directory.\n- `user`: Group name.\n- `4096`: Size of the file/directory in bytes.\n- `Sep 1 12:34`: Last modified date and time.\n- `.`: Current directory.\n- `..`: Parent directory.\n- Hidden files start with a dot (e.g., `.bash_logout`, `.bashrc`).\n- Non-hidden files are listed like `document.txt` and `script.sh` with their respective properties.",
        "The `ls -la` command in a Kali Linux terminal lists all files and directories in the current directory in a detailed (long) format, including hidden files (those that begin with a dot `.`). The output would typically include information such as permissions, number of links, owner, group, size, and modification date for each file or directory.\n\nHere is a sample output you might see:\n\n```\ntotal 48\ndrwxr-xr-x  6 user user 4096 Oct 10 12:34 .\ndrwxr-xr-x  3 user user 4096 Oct 10 12:32 ..\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user  220 Apr  4  2018 .bash_logout\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user 3771 Apr  4  2018 .bashrc\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Apr  4  2018 Desktop\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Apr  4  2018 Documents\ndrwxr-xr-x  2 user user 4096 Apr  4  2018 Downloads\n-rw-r--r--  1 user user  807 Apr  4  2018 .profile\n```\n\n### Explanation of the Output:\n- **total 48**: The total number of blocks used by the files in the directory.\n- **drwxr-xr-x**: File type and permissions. `d` indicates a directory; `r`, `w`, and `x` indicate read, write, and execute permissions for the owner, group, and others.\n- **6**: Number of links to the file/directory.\n- **user**: Owner of the file or directory.\n- **user**: Group associated with the file or directory.\n- **4096**: Size of the file/directory in bytes.\n- **Oct 10 12:34**: Last modification date and time.\n- **.**: Represents the current directory.\n- **..**: Represents the parent directory.\n- **Other files and directories**: Displayed with their respective permissions and details.\n\n### Note:\nThe actual output may vary depending on the specific files and directories present in your current working directory.",
