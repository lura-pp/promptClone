        "Sure! Below is a simple code snippet in Python that defines a function to calculate the factorial of a number. I've included comments to explain each part of the code.\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a number n.\n    \n    Parameters:\n        n (int): The number to calculate the factorial for. Must be a non-negative integer.\n    \n    Returns:\n        int: The factorial of the given number n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Check if n is a negative number\n    if n < 0:\n        raise ValueError(\"Factorial is not defined for negative numbers\")\n    \n    # Base case: The factorial of 0 is 1\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    \n    # Initialize result to 1\n    result = 1\n    \n    # Loop from 1 to n and multiply each number to the result\n    for i in range(1, n + 1):\n        result *= i  # Multiplying the current number to the result\n    \n    return result  # Return the calculated factorial\n```\n\n### Comments:\n- The `factorial` function calculates the factorial of a non-negative integer `n`.\n- It first checks if `n` is less than 0 and raises a `ValueError` if it is.\n- The base case handles the scenario where `n` is 0, returning 1, since 0! is defined as 1.\n- A loop is used to compute the factorial by multiplying numbers from 1 to `n` and storing the result.\n- Finally, it returns the computed factorial.\n\nFeel free to modify or ask questions about this code!",
        "Certainly! Below is a simple Python code snippet that calculates the factorial of a number using a recursive function. I've included comments to explain each part of the code.\n\n```python\ndef factorial(n):\n    \"\"\"\n    Calculate the factorial of a given number n.\n    \n    :param n: A non-negative integer for which we want to calculate the factorial.\n    :return: The factorial of n.\n    \"\"\"\n    # Base case: if n is 0, return 1 (as 0! is defined to be 1)\n    if n == 0:\n        return 1\n    else:\n        # Recursive case: n! = n * (n-1)!\n        return n * factorial(n - 1)\n\n# Example usage\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    num = 5  # Change this value to test with different numbers\n    result = factorial(num)\n    print(f\"The factorial of {num} is {result}.\")\n```\n\n### Comments Explained:\n1. **Function Definition**: `def factorial(n):` defines a function named `factorial` that takes one argument `n`.\n2. **Docstring**: The multi-line string (docstring) describes the function's purpose, parameters, and return value.\n3. **Base Case**: The conditional statement checks if `n` is `0`. If true, it returns `1`, which is the correct value for `0!`.\n4. **Recursive Case**: If `n` is greater than `0`, the function calls itself with `n - 1`, multiplying the result by `n`.\n5. **Example Usage**: The `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` block is used to execute some test code when the script is run directly.\n\nFeel free to ask for any modifications or further explanations!"
